Trump<\/strong>\n[nytmedia id=\"100000003839081\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s appeal owes no small amount to notions that he represents an unmistakable break from conventional politics. So the usual dictates for presidential debaters \u2014 avoid thy gaffe, for one \u2014 do not necessarily apply. His supporters will overlook an uninformed answer on a policy question, and they may even applaud an insult that, delivered by someone else, would backfire.\n \nYet even a positively huge coat of Teflon will not protect Mr. Trump from an eventual need to show that he is presidential material. He has proved, in the face of great skepticism, that he can channel the anger some grass-roots Republicans feel toward party leaders as well as their dismay about what they see as America\u2019s decline. Thursday\u2019s debate and those that will follow will help determine if Mr. Trump can take the next step and demonstrate that he has the vision and temperament to turn those raw emotions into a movement. This will require him to act more like a president than a performance artist.\n \n<strong>Jeb Bush<\/strong>\n[nytmedia id=\"100000003839082\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nIt already verges on clich\u00e9, but that does not make it any less true: Mr. Bush must show that he is more Jeb than Bush. A few million viewers with only the vaguest sense of him as anything more than the son and brother of presidents will be getting their first extended look at Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida. He has repeatedly struggled with questions about his family. So he must come to Cleveland with a concise answer that acknowledges the warm feelings many Republicans have toward the Bushes, while making plain that he is not a mere extension of a dynasty for which others in the party and beyond have little affection.\n \nPerhaps more than any other candidate, Mr. Bush also bears the pressure of having to introduce himself while coming prepared to play defense. As the closest thing to an establishment favorite, he will probably face an implied assault, if not a frontal one, from his rivals. How Mr. Bush projects his hopeful, general election-friendly brand of Republicanism while parrying questions about his conservatism will offer insights into his deftness as a candidate.\n \n<strong>Scott Walker<\/strong>\n[nytmedia id=\"100000003839076\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nHe lacks celebrity or a gilded family name, which makes the early strength Mr. Walker has demonstrated that much more remarkable. Now he must prove to Republicans who like his record as Wisconsin\u2019s governor that he has heft and poise. He has spent months on a foreign policy crash course and will need to show a grasp of issues that could confront a commander-in-chief. Like any candidate who unexpectedly builds a lead or emerges as one of the names to beat, he also has much to lose when the lights come on.\n \n<strong>Mike Huckabee<\/strong>\n[nytmedia id=\"100000003839089\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nMr. Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and 2008 presidential candidate, faces the prospect of being overtaken by new faces. To compensate, he has lately pushed the rhetorical envelope (and then some). But Mr. Huckabee is never going to out-hyperbolize Mr. Trump. And religious conservatives, not Tea Party activists, are his natural base. He needs to remind evangelicals, especially in Iowa, of what made them fall for him in the first place: his ability to project uncompromising social conservatism with a smile.\n \n<strong>Ben Carson<\/strong>\n[nytmedia id=\"100000003839072\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nConservatives looking for a break from politics as usual love the idea of Mr. Carson, an African-American doctor dispensing what they see as hard truths about the country\u2019s troubles. But he hopes to succeed where a long line of political outsiders who promised to bring a dose of common sense to the process have failed. He must show a command of policy issues to demonstrate his readiness. Critiquing Democrats and society\u2019s ills will keep the book deals coming, but it will not be enough to take him past Iowa.\n \n<strong>Ted Cruz<\/strong>\n[nytmedia id=\"100000003839097\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nNo other candidate comes with the kind of advanced billing Mr. Cruz has. He starred on his Princeton debate team. But he is not used to being interrupted. With limited time, the Texas senator must quickly demonstrate his political talent, not just his forensic skills, to the conservatives whose support he needs. That means combining the fearlessness of a Trump with the human touches of a Huckabee \u2014 and doing so in the hurly-burly of a 10-person debate.\n \n<strong>Marco Rubio<\/strong>\n[nytmedia id=\"100000003839071\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s dominance and his own focus on fund-raising kept Mr. Rubio, a Florida senator, out of the headlines for months. For Mr. Rubio, a candidate with considerable gifts as an orator, the debates that start with this first one in Ohio are an opening to prove he belongs near the front of the pack. If Mr. Walker\u2019s objective is inherently defensive \u2014 living up to poll numbers \u2014 Mr. Rubio must take the initiative and show he has the maturity and policy depth to be in contention.\n \n<strong>Rand Paul<\/strong>\n[nytmedia id=\"100000003839100\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nMr. Paul will be competing for hard-line conservative support, and he must remind more ideologically driven activists why he stands out. If he does so by making the case for a more restrained foreign policy, he will probably be attacked. But if he cogently argues his points without looking indecisive or irritated when pressed, he could rally the many primary voters who share his libertarian leanings. Mr. Paul was already suffering through a difficult summer when the head of his \u201csuper PAC\u201d was indicted on Wednesday. Few others on stage need a breakout performance as badly as Mr. Paul.\n \n<strong>Chris Christie<\/strong>\n[nytmedia id=\"100000003839058\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nIt is no surprise that a pugnacious, New York-area Republican has cast a long shadow over the campaign, but now Mr. Christie must make the case that there is room for two of them. The New Jersey governor should not try to match Mr. Trump\u2019s bombast. But the debate offers Mr. Christie a chance to show voters hungry for authenticity and fearlessness that they have a more responsible option with a cogent policy agenda.\n \nEven more than Mr. Rubio, Mr. Christie has faded in recent months. Yet no other candidate this side of Trump Tower is running more on his persona, and, as Newt Gingrich proved in the last campaign, debates offer the best platform for such aspirants to force themselves back into contention.\n \n<strong>John R. Kasich<\/strong>\n[nytmedia id=\"100000003839102\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nHe was the last candidate to make the prime-time debate, and it is important that he did: The setting in Cleveland offers Mr. Kasich, Ohio\u2019s governor, a chance to trumpet his record in one of the campaign\u2019s most important swing states. It also presents an opportunity to show fickle donors that he is a real threat to Mr. Bush.\n \nYet Mr. Kasich could waste the opportunity by underscoring perceptions that he is hopelessly undisciplined and more than a little prickly. Debates can be unforgiving for candidates with a penchant for wandering into verbal cul-de-sacs. And the need to fight for time, in his own state, with nine other candidates could reveal his abrasiveness.","parent":{"ID":5219,"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/republican-debate-election-2016-cleveland\/","title":"Debate Live: Instant Updates on Republican Debate","prettytime":"Aug 6, 2015 8:19 pm","datetime":"2015-08-06 20:19:29","timestamp":1438906769,"tags":["in-fact","chat","how-it-played","verbatim","video","photos","charts"],"admin_limit":-1,"fe_limit":40,"status":"publish","quicktags":[{"b_id":"17624","nicename":"maggie-haberman","display_name":"Maggie Haberman"},{"b_id":"65","nicename":"nicholas-confessore","display_name":"Nicholas Confessore"},{"b_id":"15360","nicename":"jonathan-martin","display_name":"Jonathan Martin"},{"b_id":"177","nicename":"michael-barbaro","display_name":"Michael Barbaro"}],"bylines":["The New York Times","Maggie Haberman","Nicholas Confessore"],"keywords":["Bush, Jeb","Carson, Benjamin S","Christie, Christopher J","Cruz, Ted","Debates (Political)","Graham, Lindsey","Huckabee, Mike","Jindal, Bobby","Kasich, John R","Pataki, George E","Paul, Rand","Perry, Rick","Polls and Public Opinion","Presidential Election of 2016","Primaries and Caucuses","Republican Party","Rubio, Marco","Santorum, Rick","Trump, Donald J","Walker, Scott K"]},"date":"2015-08-06T05:05:22","modified":"2015-08-06T17:36:40","slug":"debate-night-in-cleveland-what-the-republican-candidates-need-to-do","guid":"346-debate-night-in-cleveland-what-the-republican-candidates-need-to-do-5241","excerpt":"","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America\/New_York","date_gmt":"2015-08-06T09:05:22","modified_tz":"America\/New_York","modified_gmt":"2015-08-06T21:36:40","meta":{"links":[]},"relative_time":"16H ago","prettytime":"Aug 6, 2015 5:05 am ET","timestamp":"5:05 am ET","datestamp":"Aug 6, 2015","time":1438851922,"link":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/republican-debate-election-2016-cleveland\/debate-night-in-cleveland-what-the-republican-candidates-need-to-do\/","shortlink":["http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1IngyHX"],"admin_link":"http:\/\/live-admin.em.nytimes.com\/republican-debate-election-2016-cleveland\/debate-night-in-cleveland-what-the-republican-candidates-need-to-do\/","authors":[{"b_id":"15360","image":{"full":"","50":"","75":"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2014\/09\/22\/us\/politics\/Jonathan-Martin\/First-Draft-avatars-slide-HU74-thumbLarge.png"},"twitter":"jmartnyt","facebook":"","email":"","website":"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/people\/m\/jonathan_martin\/index.html","scoop_id":"20129","title_case_name":"","name":"Jonathan Martin","slug":"jonathan-martin"}],"content_expanded":"<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The 10 leading Republican presidential candidates enter Thursday night\u2019s face-off hoping to impress primary voters and contributors, while avoiding the sort of missteps that often make for the most memorable moments of a debate.

Few others on stage need a breakout performance as badly as Mr. Paul.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>Chris Christie<\/strong><br \/>\n<div class=\"w592\"><figure class=\"media photo promo\" itemprop=\"\" itemscope=\"\" itemid=\"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/08\/05\/us\/politics\/earlyAMcandidates-christie\/earlyAMcandidates-christie-tmagArticle.jpg\" itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/ImageObject\" role=\"group\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo<\/span><div class=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/republican-debate-election-2016-cleveland\/debate-night-in-cleveland-what-the-republican-candidates-need-to-do\/\"><img itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/08\/05\/us\/politics\/earlyAMcandidates-christie\/earlyAMcandidates-christie-tmagArticle.jpg\" src=\"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/08\/05\/us\/politics\/earlyAMcandidates-christie\/earlyAMcandidates-christie-tmagArticle.jpg\" id=\"100000003839058\" width=\"592\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Gov.

The New Jersey governor should not try to match Mr. Trump\u2019s bombast. But the debate offers Mr. Christie a chance to show voters hungry for authenticity and fearlessness that they have a more responsible option with a cogent policy agenda.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Even more than Mr. Rubio, Mr. Christie has faded in recent months. Yet no other candidate this side of Trump Tower is running more on his persona, and, as Newt Gingrich proved in the last campaign, debates offer the best platform for such aspirants to force themselves back into contention.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>John R.

It also presents an opportunity to show fickle donors that he is a real threat to Mr. Bush.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Yet Mr. Kasich could waste the opportunity by underscoring perceptions that he is hopelessly undisciplined and more than a little prickly. Debates can be unforgiving for candidates with a penchant for wandering into verbal cul-de-sacs. And the need to fight for time, in his own state, with nine other candidates could reveal his abrasiveness.<\/p>\n","highlight":false,"homepage":true,"standalone":true,"share_image":"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/08\/06\/us\/politics\/repubdebate08062015-138\/repubdebate08062015-138-facebookJumbo.jpg","homepage_title":"","dateline":"","selected_tags":[],"tags":["in-fact","chat","how-it-played","verbatim","video","photos","charts"],"in-fact":false,"chat":false,"how-it-played":false,"verbatim":false,"video":false,"photos":false,"charts":false,"locked":0}]
