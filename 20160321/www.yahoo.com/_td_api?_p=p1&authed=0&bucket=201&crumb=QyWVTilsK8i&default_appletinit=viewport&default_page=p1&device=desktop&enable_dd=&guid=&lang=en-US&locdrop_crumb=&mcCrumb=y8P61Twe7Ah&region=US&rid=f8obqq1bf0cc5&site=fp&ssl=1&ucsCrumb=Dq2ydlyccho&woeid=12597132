Equipment that is unnatural and designed to increase a player's height or reach, or to gain an advantage, shall not be used.\"</p>","<p>Players are generally permitted to use certain substances to improve grip during games. Rosin, both in powder and liquid form, is commonly and legally used to prevent hands from sweating. Stickum is illegal, as referee Monty McCutchen made clear to the Rockets and Hawks benches after Atlanta forward Paul Millsap complained that the ball was coated in a foreign substance.</p>","<p>The use of Stickum â or something similar â is not uncommon. Some players use Q.D.A., a quick drying adherent used to keep tape on player's feet and ankles. Howard says he has been using Stickum for five years. Several players and coaches told The Vertical they have no issue with Howard or any other player using a Stickum-like substance, provided it doesn't affect the game ball, like it did in Atlanta.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>\"I've never felt the ball like that ever,\" Millsap told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution after the game. \"It was sticky. It was like super glue or something was on there. I couldn't get it off my hands. It was the weirdest thing ever.\"</p>","<p>\"Stickum,\" an NBA head coach told The Vertical, \"hasn't helped Dwight shoot free throws.\"</p>","<p>The Howard situation has been exacerbated by the Rockets' immediate reaction to it. When McCutchen approached the Rockets' bench on Saturday, Houston coach J.B. Bickerstaff appeared to move in front of the can in an attempt to block it from McCutchen's view. Several league executives told The Vertical that if anyone should be punished it's the Rockets, who knew the substance Howard was using was illegal â the can was covered in white tape â and then tried to cover it up.</p>","<p>Still, it's unlikely the NBA issues a stiff punishment, if it issues any at all. The league could fine the Rockets and Howard; it could suspend Howard for a game. More likely, the NBA will circulate a memo reminding teams that Stickum-like substances are against the rules and players using them will be subject to future punishment.</p>","<p><strong>More NBA coverage from The Vertical:</strong></p>","<p><strong><span class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n   <div style=\"left:0px;\" id=\"ymh-player-swf\" class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\">\n    <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><div class=\"js-video-placeholder RatioBox Bgc-x Bd-0\" data-yepConfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;page_space_id&quot;:&quot;1197799274&quot;,&quot;video_uuid&quot;:&quot;cc6e3040-1604-3315-b597-470d4dbfec50&quot;,&quot;device&quot;:&quot;desktop&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;sports&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{&quot;showTitle&quot;:true,&quot;showDescription&quot;:true,&quot;showButton&quot;:true,&quot;showProvider&quot;:false},&quot;width&quot;:640}\"></div></div>\n   </div></span></strong></p>","<p></p>"]},"property":"sports","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"7f277938-3d48-3e05-b880-65b20091f2f1","licensed":"true","title":"North Korea fires short-range projectiles into sea amid tension over nuclear ambitions","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-fires-short-range-projectiles-sea-070034649.html","summary":"North Korea fired five short-range projectiles into the sea off its east coast on Monday, South Korea&#39;s military said, amid heightened tension over the isolated country&#39;s nuclear and rocket programs.

A doctor there may refer you to a urologist, who may be able to get the problem corrected.<p> In addition, I urge you to talk to a licensed mental health professional to help you work through your anger because it may be misdirected and a result of the sexual assault you experienced in grade school.<p> \n     <hr size=\"1\" width=\"75%\" noshade=\"\" align=\"center\">\n       DEAR ABBY: My husband and I live in a small house on a small lot. We don't have children, but love kids. Our problem is our next-door neighbors, whose two elementary school-age boys have limited supervision. They're always in our yard digging and leaving their toys around. Honestly, their own yard is bigger.\n      <p> They constantly come over asking for candy, and the other day while my husband was working from home, he heard someone trying to open the door and pushing the keypad for entry. Needless to say, it was one of the boys.<p> I have tried asking them nicely to retrieve their toys, etc., but I'm getting really frustrated and afraid I'm going to lose my patience soon and blow. Please help us. -- TRYING TO REMAIN NICE NEIGHBORS<p> DEAR TRYING: You say you have spoken to the boys, but have you spoken to their parents? That one of the boys would try to gain entry to your house -- I assume thinking there was no one there -- is worrisome, and the parents should be put on notice about it. (In some neighborhoods the outcome could be dangerous.) If you can't get them to take action, then consider fencing your yard.<p> \n          <hr size=\"1\" width=\"75%\" noshade=\"\" align=\"center\">\n            Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.
