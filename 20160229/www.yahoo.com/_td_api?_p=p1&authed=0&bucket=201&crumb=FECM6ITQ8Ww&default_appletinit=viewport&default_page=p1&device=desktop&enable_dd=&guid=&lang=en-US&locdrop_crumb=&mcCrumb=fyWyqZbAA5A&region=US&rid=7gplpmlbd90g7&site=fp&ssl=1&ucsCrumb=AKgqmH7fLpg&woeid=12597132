Obama announced the executive action in late 2014, but it was challenged in court by 26 states, which argued that he had overstepped his authority and that the program would impose an unfair financial burden on them.

They brought their act to the Oscars, bantering amusingly on the definition of âAdapted Screenplayâ (Gosling was wrong) and how many Oscars they had between the two of them (again, Gosling was wrong).</p>","<p><b>HIGH: Rock Unleashes the Girl Scouts<br /></b>After noting that his daughters had a tough time selling Girl Scout cookies last year, the host brought out a whole troop to hit up the deep-pocketed attendees. And suddenly weâre seeing Steven Spielberg wave a wad of cash in the air and Matt Damon snarfing Thin Mints. Itâs not quite the water-cooler moment of Ellenâs similar pizza stunt, but it made a bigger difference. Rock later announced the girls had raised over $65,000. Cha-ching!</p>","<p><b>LOW: The Thank-You Scroll & Playoff Music<br /></b>The academy âhelpfullyâ tried to keep acceptance speeches short and punchy by letting winners thank their family, co-workers, and chosen deities via a ticker at the bottom of the screen. But the effect was distracting, resembling visual clutter rather than a meaningful message (Notable exception:<i> Inside Out</i> director Pete Docterâs message to his kids: âOK, yes, letâs get a dog.â). The producers also struck the wrong chord with the musical interludes. As if the orchestraâs song choices of famous movie music werenât odd enough, the renditions often fell flat â the Muzak-y version of Amy Winehouseâs âRehabâ played when <i>Amy</i> won Best Documentary Feature was particularly unsettling.</p>","<p><b>LOW: That Anticlimactic Jack Black Bit<br /></b>For the most part, Rockâs comedy game was on point. But he probably should have left the Will Smith gags in the monologue. In a follow-up video bit, he enlisted Angela Bassett to pretend that she was honoring the star of <i>Enemy of the State </i>and <i>Shark Tale </i>for Black History Month. But surprise! Turns out she was talking about <i>Jack Black</i>. We love <i>School of Rock </i>and all, but Jack Black doesnât really deserve his own history month. And Bassett <i>definitely </i>didnât deserve being saddled with that leaden joke. Â </p>","<p><b>HIGH: Straight Into Compton<br /></b>The NWA biopic <i>Straight Outta Compton</i> was largely snubbed by the academy, but Rock found the titular Los Angeles-adjacent city the perfect location to gauge the reactions of black Americans to #OscarsSoWhite. In an inspired bit, he posed questions like, âDo you think <i>Trumbo</i> should have been a bigger hit?â and oftentimes his interviewees thought he was making up the film titles (<i>Bridge of Spies</i>?

Those unfortunate souls this year included two beloved character actors, Abe Vigoda (<i>The Godfather</i>,<i> Look Whoâs Talking</i>) and Geoffrey Lewis (<i>Maverick</i>, <i>Every Which Way But Loose</i>), prompting a <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/news/744300/where-s-abe-vigoda-late-actor-among-stars-snubbed-from-the-oscars-2016-in-memoriam-tv-tribute\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Twitter outcry</a>, including a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JulietteLewis/status/704158367644647424\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">heartfelt message from Lewisâs actress daughter, Juliette</a>.

But Louis C.K. made it must-see TV with an impassioned, hysterical plea about how important Best Documentary Short is to the otherwise unknown, not-as-wealthy nominees. âThis Oscarâs going home in a Honda Civic,â said the comedian, who immediately became our pick to host the 2017 Oscars.</p>","<p><b>HIGH: <i>Mad Max</i> Cleans Up Tech Categories<br /></b>Our hearts soared as we bore witness to <i>Fury Road</i>âs six Oscar triumphs in the technical categories, winning Production Design, Costume Design, Makeup and Hairstyling, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and Film Editing. Sadly, Max and Furiosaâs ride to awards Valhalla ended there, but it was glorious while it lasted. Excuse us while we rewatch it for the 15th time.</p>","<p><b>LOW: Sly Loses<br /></b>No, Adrian! Looks like Rocky Balboa is gonna remain an eternal underdog. Despite being favored to win the Best Supporting Actor statue for the role he originated 40 years ago, Sylvester Stalloneâs Oscar hopes got KOâd by stealth <i>Bridge of Spies </i>winner, Mark Rylance. The upset loss prompted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/704149493185294341\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">touching tweet </a>from Slyâs longtime pal Arnold Schwarzenegger: âTo me, youâre the best, no matter what they say.â Rylance also beat out another acting heavyweight, Mark Ruffalo, whose <i>Spotlight </i>performance won stellar reviews. Fortunately, he didnât Hulk out at the news. </p>","<p><b>HIGH: Lady Gagaâs Emotional Performance<br /></b>Thatâs two years in a row that a live rendition of a Best Original Song nominee moved viewers to tears. In 2015, it was Common and John Legendâs performance of âGloryâ from <i>Selma</i> that brought the house down. This year, after being introduced by Vice President Joe Biden, it was Gaga who <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/celebrity/brie-larson-hugs-every-sexual-assault-survivor-052750529.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">gave a stirring performance of âTil It Happens to Youâ</a> from the documentary <i>The Hunting Ground</i> surrounded by survivors of sexual abuse.</p>","<p><b>HIGH: Leo Finally Wins<br /></b>In one of the most highly anticipated â and highly predictable â sequences of the night, Leonardo DiCaprio won his first Academy Award (for <i>The Revenant</i>) after five previously unsuccessful attempts. The crowd rose quickly to its feet as DiCaprio offered gracious thanks before using the moment to champion environmental issues long close to his heart. âClimate change is real,â he said. âLet us not take this planet for granted.

Marco Rubio shakes hands with supporters at a rally in Purcellville, Va., on Feb. 28. (Photo: Cliff Owen/AP)</i></p>","<p>PURCELLVILLE, Va. â When Marco Rubio recalled his debate showdown with his rival for the Republican presidential nomination Donald Trump, the rush of applause and cheering that filled a college gymnasium here Sunday afternoon sounded like a huge sigh of relief.</p>","<p>For the several thousand listening to the U.S. senator from Florida, the emergence of someone â anyone â to throw punches back at Trump was cathartic.</p>","<p>In fact, the crowd didnât even let Rubio finish his sentence when he brought up the debate in Houston. He began: âThursday night, I decided that it was time to unmask the true nature of a manââ</p>","<p>The rest was drowned out by the roar of the crowd here on the campus of Patrick Henry College, an hour west of Washington, D.C.</p>","<p>As Mike Farris, the chancellor of Patrick Henry College, and one of the pioneers of the Christian homeschooling movement in the United States, put it: âSomebody has to tell the truth about Donald Trump.â</p>","<p>To evangelicals like Farris, the unleashing of Rubio over the last three days has made him the âpremier challengerâ to Trump. Thatâs despite the fact that a former student remarked to me that he had thought Farris would endorse Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, whose background in competitive debating makes him a model of the kind of student Patrick Henry tries to produce.</p>","<p>Yet Farris said that at Patrick Henry, âMost of the student body, for sure, and many of the faculty and others are definitely leaning strongly toward Rubio.â</p>","<p>âTrump is a persona non grata around here, mostly,â Farris said. âThereâs a good amount of Cruz support as well. â¦ But I think Rubioâs approach â the hope for the next generation â is more appealing to most of the people here.â</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Rubio held four rallies Sunday in different parts of Virginia, one of four states where his campaign holds out hope of stealing a win from Trump on Super Tuesday. There are 12 states holding primaries or caucuses Tuesday. The Rubio campaign thinks it can perform best in Virginia, Arkansas, Minnesota and Oklahoma.</p>","<p>The Virginia barnstorming tour continued at a furious pace for Rubio, who also held four events in three states on Saturday and has five events in four states scheduled for Monday. The almost frantic schedule underscores the reality for Rubio â that although he has momentum, he is still far behind Trump in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/march1GOP.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">most polls</a>, and desperately needs a win somewhere Tuesday.</p>","<p>Rubio has succeeded, however, in diverting some of the political conversation away from Trump.</p>","<p>On Sunday morning, Trump found himself on the defensive on each of the four news talk shows to which he gave interviews. On âFox News Sunday,â for example, his interview with Chris Wallace hit five topics: Rubioâs charge that Trump is âa con manâ; the admission by Trump that illegal immigrants from Poland worked on the construction of Trump Tower; criticisms about the legitimacy of a now-defunct business called Trump University; the question of whether Trump will release his tax returns; and Trumpâs comments that he would like to make it easier to sue news organizations for libel.</p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/2016-presidential-campaign-debates/rubio-trump-spar-over-immigration-022829433.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>","<p>Trump also doubled down on a statement he made after Thursdayâs debate, in response to questions about why he has hired hundreds of foreign-born immigrants for jobs at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, even though job applications were receivedÂ <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/politics/donald-trump-taps-foreign-work-force-for-his-florida-club.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">from hundreds of American citizens</a>. As he has before, Trump insisted that many American citizens would not want such jobs, an argument that undercuts his harsh anti-immigration rhetoric.</p>","<p>âA lot of the people that we have made offers to â¦ when they hear itâs a part-time job, or a itâs a four-month or five-month job â and I understand this â theyâre not interested. Theyâre American people. Theyâre not interested,â Trump said on CBSâ âFace the Nation.â</p>","<p>Continuing his newsmaking Sunday, Trump also refused, on CNNâs âState of the Union,â to repudiate former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, and the Klan itself.</p>","<p>âWould you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you donât want their support?â CNNâs Jake Tapper asked Trump.</p>","<p>âWell, I have to look at the group. I mean, I donât know what group youâre talking about,â Trump said. âCertainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong.â</p>","<p>âI mean, Iâm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here,â Tapper said.</p>","<p>âHonestly, I donât know David Duke. I donât believe I have ever met him. Iâm pretty sure I didnât meet him. And I just donât know anything about him,â Trump replied.</p>","<p>Trump was not telling the truth. In 2000, heÂ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyJWUwG7oJ0\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">told Matt Lauer on NBCâs âThe Today Showâ</a> that he was not going to run for president as a candidate of the Reform Party precisely because of Dukeâs involvement in the party.</p>","<p>âYouâve got David Duke just joined: a bigot, a racist, a problem. This is not exactly the people you want in your party,â Trump told Lauer.</p>","<p>In Virginia, Rubio told the crowd at Patrick Henry about Trumpâs statements in 2000. âHe knows exactly who David Duke is,â Rubio said. âWe cannot be a party that nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan.â</p>","<p>Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the Republican Partyâs only African-American senator, released a statement saying that âAny candidate who cannot immediately condemn a hate group like the KKK does not represent the Republican Party, and will not unite it.â</p>","<p>Trump was clearly irritated by Rubioâs calling him a âcon man,â in return mocking Rubio during his one public event of the day, in Alabama.</p>","<p>âNow he wants to act like a big man. âOh, Trumpâs a con man. Trumpâs a con man.â Iâm a con man?â Trump said. âI built a business. â¦ And I gotta listen to this guy?â</p>","<p>Trump returned to the subject later in his speech.</p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/iHugocDNLfarnbsIltvHbA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/8c957d9850fd52645ea64810054c64f2/tumblr_inline_o3be13myu91t2npxi_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"413.78330373001774\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Madison, Ala., onÂ <i>Feb. 28.Â </i>(Photo: John Bazemore/AP)</i></p>","<p>âIt was such an insulting thing.

Chris Christie. Christie, who dropped out of the race, has since endorsed Trump.</p>","<p>âWe donât need a fainter to negotiate with China and Putin. We donât need a fainter to knock the hell out of ISIS,â Trump said, intimating that Rubio would not be up to the task of president. âWe donât need a guy whoâs sweating and scared.â</p>","<p>At Rubioâs last rally of the day, in rural southwest Virginia, he responded to Trump with more of the ridicule that he has begun to use against the reality TV star. Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajjaffe/status/704133318544121856\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Rubio said</a>, âdoesnât sweat because his pores are clogged from the spray tan.â</p>","<p>He also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajjaffe/status/704132752086589440\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">alluded to</a>Â the size of Trumpâs hands, a subject about which TrumpÂ <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/10/graydon-carter-donald-trump\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">has shown that he is apparently insecure</a>, and used it to call into question Mr. Trumpâs manhood.</p>","<p>âHeâs always calling me âLittle Marco.â Iâll admit, heâs taller than me. Heâs like 6-foot-2, which is why I donât understand why his hands are the size of someone whoâs 5-foot-2â. Have you seen his hands?â Rubio said, holding up his hands with fingers clenched. âThey look like this.â</p>","<p>âAnd you know what they say about men with small hands,â <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv7bT0ik3Wg&feature=youtu.be\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Rubio joked</a>. âYou canât trust them.â</p>","<p>The Republican primary has entered into new territory over the last week. Trumpâs huge win in the Nevada caucuses last Tuesday, following big victories in South Carolina a week ago and in New Hampshire on Feb. 9, has ushered in a sense of doom for those in the Republican Party who thought he would eventually fade or self-destruct.</p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/gZs.3D2y53UiGYbWiUrGcw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/8366cb16e30a310dfc8f5b49130c1b82/tumblr_inline_o3be6goj0h1t2npxi_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"426.6666666666667\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Sen.

(Photo: Carlos Barria/Reuters)</i></p>","<p>Rubio has emerged as the only Republican willing, and able for at least a few days now, to counter Trumpâs brutal mockery and outsized, dominating media presence. Underneath the jokes, Rubio and his campaign are nearing a place of no return, of total and complete opposition to Trump that precludes ever closing ranks behind Trump if he is the nominee.</p>","<p>Other Republicans are reaching a similar point. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who has been an outspoken critic of Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenSasse/status/704144137973583877\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">said on Twitter</a> Sunday night that if Trump becomes the nominee, he will not support him. âIf Trump becomes the Republican nominee, my expectation is that Iâll look for some third candidate â a conservative option, a Constitutionalist,â Sasse <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenSasse/status/704144755509305344\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">wrote</a>.</p>","<p>Rubio, who used the hashtag #NeverTrump on Twitter this past weekend, talked openly of a contested convention on CBSâ âFace the Nation.â</p>","<p>âLet me just say the rules are what they are in the Republican Party. You have to have <i>x</i> number of delegates in order to be the nominee. And if you donât have those number of delegates, then thereâs a process in place,â Rubio said.</p>","<p>âHere is what is never going to happen in this race: Thereâs never going to be a time where the Republican Party rallies around and says, âYou have to get out, or anyone has to get out, for purposes of rallying around Donald Trump,ââ Rubio said. âAnd so weâre going to do whatever [it] takes. We will be in this race as long as it takes.â</p>","<p>Rubio repeated this point on Fox News.</p>","<p>âYou need 1,237 delegates to be the Republican nominee.

So, to realign us with the Earthâs movement around the sun, an extra day â 24 hours â is built into the calendar once every four years.</p>","<p>Think thatâs confusing? Up until Julius Caesar came along and created his own calendar, people observed a 355-day year with an extra month called <a href=\"http://blog.dictionary.com/mercedonius/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Mercedonius</a>. Caesar did away with that complicated system by creating a new day, which we now know as Feb. 29. But his math didnât quite add up either. So, when Pope Gregory XIII reformed the system in 1582, he did some fine-tuning and gave Feb. 29 a permanent place on the new Gregorian calendar â once every four years. </p>","<p>The way the math works out, a century year is a leap year only if it is divisible by 400. Â So years such as 1700, 1800 and 1900 werenât leap years. But, of course, 2016 is. <br /></p>","<p>Leap day itself, Feb. 29, has long been the inspiration of folklore, most notably a tradition out of the United Kingdom of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/02/24/leap-year-has-a-rich-history-in-marriage-proposals_n_9307844.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">women proposing</a> to their significant others. </p>","<p>And what about people born on Feb. 29? Technically speaking, their birthdays only roll around once every four years. So, that means this year, actor Antonio Sabato Jr. will have his 11th birthday, self-help guru Tony Robbins will have his 14th and rapper <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/search/name?birth_monthday=02-29\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Ja Rule</a> will be celebrating his 10th. </p>","<p>So, while others might feel âdayâzed and confused on Feb. 29, at least you can say, âNow I get it!â</p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"katiecouric","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"52349eca-e1c7-38e9-9e0b-00cb1896edfe","licensed":"true","title":"How Fast Food Players Are Battling Back Against McDonaldâs All Day Breakfast","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/fast-food-players-battling-back-130043742.html","summary":"Counteroffensives have been launched.","entities":"WIKIID:Jack_in_the_Box|WIKIID:Burger_King","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000072","publisher":"Money","author":"Brad Tuttle","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/aaNk7uvNQ9JnHQQ040nK8w--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-02-03/a5f3ddf0-cacc-11e5-8acc-ab54b7083ae5_0d6e93875aaabd03e83ff16d25ff0315.jpg","provider_url":"http://time.com/money/","site":"finance","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"1183300100","propertyRegion":"YPROP:finance","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"1183300100","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Jack_in_the_Box;Burger_King;Fast_food;Taco_Bell;Food;Foodborne_illness;Subway_%28restaurant%29;Burrito\" rs=\"lmsid:a0ad000000BferrAAB;revsp:money_403;lpstaid:52349eca-e1c7-38e9-9e0b-00cb1896edfe\"","site":"finance","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"4 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo Finance","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000072","score":"0.7","label":"Dining & Nightlife"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>Last fall's move by McDonald's to offer <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4062667/mcdonalds-all-day-breakfast/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">all-day breakfast</a> nationwide has been a monster success for the fast food giant, and the effects have been felt throughout the industry.
