(AP) -- Tornadoes ripped through an RV park in Louisiana and significantly damaged nearly 100 homes and apartments in Florida, and forecasters warned that more twisters were possible Wednesday as the deadly storm system moved to the East Coast.</p> <p>At least three people were killed and dozens of people were injured, some critically.</p> <p>One of the hardest-hit areas along the Gulf Coast on Tuesday was a recreational vehicle park in the town of Convent, in southern Louisiana. RVs were tossed about and lay on top of wrecked cars and pickup trucks.</p> <p>Two people were killed there, and 31 injured people were taken to area hospitals, said St. James Parish Sheriff Will Martin. Seven of them were in critical condition, he said.</p> <p>An all-night search of the RV park found no additional injuries or fatalities, the sheriff said. Three people were still missing and Martin said he hoped to locate them Wednesday.</p> <p>Briaxton Lott, 23, was in the trailer park when the tornado hit. The pad where his trailer once sat was empty and he pointed to the remnants of his trailer about 100 feet away.</p> <p>\"The whole front end came up and slammed back down, and I grabbed up the baby and the next thing I know we just went rolling end over end,\" Lott said.</p> <p>His destroyed trailer ended up right next to three trailers that appeared untouched. Children's toys were scattered in the mud, and an alarm could be heard going off in the morning, likely alerting a long-gone resident it was time to go to work. Remains of the jumbled and mashed trailers and vehicles were scattered across the park.</p> <p>Lott, who was in the trailer with his wife, two kids and their dog, didn't even know where the top of his trailer was. He came back in the morning to dig out some possessions, including family Bibles and items inherited from an uncle who passed away.</p> <p>When asked his plans for the future Lott said: \"Just keep moving forward. We'll definitely be going to church Sunday, definitely.\"</p> <p>Thousands of people across the Gulf Coast region were without power and the threat of more tornadoes remained. At least 88 million people along the East Coast were at some sort of risk of severe weather Wednesday, the Storm Prediction Center said.</p> <p>Some of the larger metro areas included the North Carolina cities of Raleigh and Wake Forest. Straight-line wind gusts may be particularly strong, reaching 70 mph or greater.</p> <p>Forecasters with the National Weather Service had to take cover Tuesday in a shelter in Slidell, Louisiana, because a tornado was nearby. Lightning took out the office's radar, forcing them to use backups.</p> <p>\"We felt the shockwave go through the building,\" said Ken Graham of the National Weather Service.</p> <p>The storms dumped several inches of rain in Alabama, Georgia and elsewhere, causing flash flood watches.</p> <p>By 7 a.m. Wednesday, Albany, Georgia, had recorded 3.58 inches of rain in a 24-hour period. In Atlanta, the two-day total was approaching 3 inches before dawn Wednesday.</p> <p>Schools were closed in parts of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina ahead of the storms.</p> <p>At least seven tornadoes hit Louisiana and Mississippi.</p> <p>In Mississippi, one person, 73-year-old Dale Purvis, died of blunt-force trauma in a mobile home west of Purvis, Lamar County Coroner Cody Creel said.</p> <p>Florida Gov. Rick Scott said an apparent tornado in the Pensacola area significantly damaged more than 70 homes and 24 apartments, leaving three people with minor injuries.</p> <p>He stopped at The Moorings apartment complex, where winds whipped the roof off of at least two buildings. A tangled wall of tree limbs and power lines partially blocked the entrance to the apartment complex. A large oak tree fell on the side of one building and dozens of cars in the parking lot were smashed under a layer of wood, twisted metal, insulation and other debris.</p> <p>\"I was on the phone with my sister.

The Tuesday, February 23, episode of <i>The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story </i>found <b>O.J. Simpson</b> (<b>Cuba Gooding Jr.</b>) in the hands of a team of lawyers who were being steered in a new direction by their latest addition, Johnnie Cochran (<b>Courtney B. Vance</b>). While they got to work on a defense, they started looking for a jury and so, too, did the prosecution. As it turned out, the defense team itself had plenty of drama to go around.</span><br /></p>","<p><b>All Work and No Play Makes O.J. a Mad Boy</b></p>","<p>The episode opened on a club scene. O.J. was seen dancing and railing many, many lines of cocaine. His friends, including Robert Kardashian (<b>David Schwimmer</b>), were seen around him, dancing with women, eating good food and having fun.</p>","<p><a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/american-crime-story-compare-oj-simpson-trials-real-people-with-cast-w163938?utm_source=yahoocelebrity&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">PHOTOS: 'People v.

O.J. stood up and flipped the only item in his cell that wasnât nailed down as his real circumstances and ever-present temper came back to him.</span><br /></p>","<p>His friends werenât out having fun either, however. The next scene showed them all gathered in an office, preparing his defense. It pays to be friends with a bunch of lawyers!</p>","<p><b>Robert Shapiro</b> (<b>John Travolta</b>) started the session off with a bang, saying, âFirst question: Who thinks O.J. did it?â </p>","<p>Johnnie jumped in from there, explaining that while it was mostly good news that the jury would be pulled from the downtown area â because that region was primarily made up of black people, and O.J. was a hero in the community â black women might pose a problem.</p>","<p><a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/celebrity-mugshots-2013294?utm_source=yahoocelebrity&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">PHOTOS: Celebrity Mugshots</a></p>","<p><span style=\"\">âThey donât like their men marrying white girls,â he said, referring to </span><span style=\"\">Nicole Brown</span><span style=\"\">, the ex-wife of O.J. who had been found murdered, prompting his arrest and subsequent murder charges.</span><br /></p>","<p>Prosecutor <b>Marcia Clark</b> (<b>Sarah Paulson</b>) showed up to court looking like she, too, was all work and no play, but Johnnie proved immediately that she had finally met her match. She wanted 100 hairs from O.J. for evidence, and he fought her so hard that a separate hearing was set up just to discuss the hair. </p>","<p><b>Absolutely, 100 Percent Not â¦ Positive</b></p>","<p>After showing Marcia what he was made of, Johnnie went to visit O.J. in jail, telling him he had to stay strong if he wanted to change the minds of the jury and the public. To get him to be the man he knew he could be, Johnnie told O.J. how much he had inspired him when he was a football player who didnât allow any obstacles to get in his way.</p>","<p>âYou are O.J. Simpson, and you are an inspiration,â his lawyer told him.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>âI am!â said O.J. âIâm an inspiration.â</p>","<p><a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/im-dating-an-athlete-20092610?utm_source=yahoocelebrity&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">PHOTOS: Celebrities Dating Athletes</a></p>","<p><span style=\"\">When the plea hearing began, O.J. stood attentively, then pleaded, âAbsolutely 100 percent not guilty.â</span><br /></p>","<p>The lawyers gave him a thumbs-up, but later, at a secret dinner, Shapiro and <b>F. Lee Bailey</b> (<b>Nathan Lane</b>) discussed Shapiroâs conviction that the case was âunwinnable.â</p>","<p>Once Lee asked about the money he was expecting for his defense, Shapiro switched gears again, saying, âI like this case for you!â and assuring him that no matter the outcome, being associated with the case would put Lee back in the limelight again.</p>","<p><b>Her Lifeâs an Open Book </b></p>","<p><b>Faye Resnick </b>(<b>Connie Britton</b>) â friend to Nicole and <b>Kris Jenner </b>(<b>Selma Blair</b>), who had once been married to Kardashian â was seen in an office setting, talking about her deceased friend.</p>","<p>âNicole was my everything, you know? She was my confidant, my spiritual sister,â Faye said, then claiming that after going to a psychic, she learned that Nicole âwantedâ her to write a book, though not one that would be exploitative. </p>","<p>The publisher agreed that a book was a good idea, but warned Faye that the window to get the manuscript to print was only two weeks. She got to work rattling off things about Nicole right then and there, calling her a good mother who enjoyed clubbing, eating, Starbucks and â¦ cocaine. </p>","<p><a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/hollywoods-most-expensive-divorces-2009188?utm_source=yahoocelebrity&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">PHOTOS: Hollywood's Most Expensive Divorces</a></p>","<p><span style=\"\">Obviously on a lot of coke herself, Faye continued to talk about Nicole at the editorâs insistence, discussing her friendâs breast implants and sexual proclivities rapidly.</span><br /></p>","<p>The prosecution had their own version of a tell-all too; theyâd been busy collecting information and evidence and had established a timeline, thanks to the work of <b>Christopher Darden</b> (<b>Sterling K. Brown</b>). It was no juicy book about Nicole, but it was something to work with while trying to solve her murder.</p>","<p>The family of Ron Goldman, the other person who was found dead at the crime scene, visited Marcia. His father sobbed and screamed in her office, proving to be an open book himself by expressing anger over not only his childâs violent death, but his representation in the media. Marcia grabbed his hand, promising to âgetâ the killer. </p>","<p><b>Sheâs a Triflinâ Friend Indeed</b></p>","<p>After her encounter with Ronâs family, Marcia was pulling for the death penalty because jurors selected for that type of trial would be even harsher. Her colleagues were quick to remind her that O.J. was an American legend and no one would ever vote for his execution. To put it in perspective, they said that even <b>Charles Manson</b> didnât get the death penalty.</p>","<p>They moved on to discussing jury selection. Marcia brought up wanting a jury of black women, saying theyâd be sympathetic to Nicole because they would be more likely to be familiar with patterns of domestic abuse. </p>","<p>While watching a focus group conducted by a jury selection expert, Marcia and her colleagues were confronted by the reality of how pervasive the idea was that a hero like O.J. couldnât have killed anyone. The members of the focus group went so far as to turn on Marcia, calling her a shifty bitch. </p>","<p>The jury expert told her not to put black women on the jury. The experts hired by the defense, however, encouraged them to put black women on because their focus group found that they considered O.J. masculine, handsome and charming. Meanwhile, they had no sympathy for Nicole, calling her a gold digger.</p>","<p>Kardashian, who had been her friend, was horrified, insisting she wasnât a gold digger. Back at the publishing house, Faye echoed his sentiments, claiming that Nicole had loved O.J. </p>","<p><b>Let the Games Begin! </b></p>","<p>At jury selection, the crowds were incredible, and more than 900 people were in the running to be named to the jury. The defense and prosecution were letting them go left and right. Johnnie wondered aloud whether too many potential jurors of color were being dismissed, and Shapiro offered to tell the press. </p>","<p>Johnnie shot that down, saying that the white Shapiro shouldnât speak on the suspected racism. Shapiro shot back that he was lead attorney, so he would host the press conference. As he did that, Johnnie demonstrated his power by getting a shoe shine and letting reporters come to him. </p>","<p>After the suspected racism made the front page, Marcia brought Chris aboard the main prosecuting team after it was suggested to her that it would be beneficial to have a black lawyer on their side. (Ultimately, the jury ended up with a large amount of people of color, especially women.)</p>","<p>Then they had even bigger problems, believe it or not: Fayeâs book came out, complicating the trial further. Jury selection was temporarily suspended, and prosecutors and defense attorneys got to work reading the book, which immediately become a<i> New York Times</i> bestseller and got Faye on-air with <b>Larry King</b>, where she claimed she âtold Nicoleâs story so women can break the chain of violence.â</p>","<p>The tensions between Shapiro and Johnnie continued to mount, prompting Lee to appear on <i>Larry King</i> to claim that the tensions didnât exist at all, in spite of media reports to the contrary. Back in real life, Johnnie found a witness, while Shapiro did what everyone had suspected he would do and encouraged O.J. to plead guilty to manslaughter. Suddenly, everyone on the dream team was taking orders only from Johnnie.</p>","<p>Johnnie wasnât the only one who wanted Shapiro off the case, either. Shapiro's wife was horrified that he would defend a man everyone thought was guilty. She was upset none of her friends would talk to her anymore because she was affiliated with O.J.âs defense. Shapiroâs time leading the dream team looked to be dwindling, especially after Kardashian stepped in and asked O.J. to make Johnnie lead attorney. He obliged.</p>","<p>Their confidence in the new leadership only lasted until they walked into the courtroom and saw Chris. </p>","<p>âWhere did they get a black guy?!â whispered O.J.</p>","<p>Tell <i>Us:</i> Are you surprised by the effect Fayeâs book had?</p>","<p><i>The People v.

O.J. Simpson,â Johnnie Cochran was no longer on the sidelines â heâdÂ officially joinedÂ the infamous âdream team.â It only gets more intense from here, as in the coming weeks, heâll command the courtroom â delivering those legendary one-liners.</p>","<p>The man who embodies him onscreen,Â <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/courtney-b-vance/\" id=\"auto-tag_courtney-b-vance\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Courtney B. Vance</a> has won raves for his commanding performance.Â Here, Vance tells <em>Variety</em>Â how he prepared for the role, and the impact the series has on modern-day race relations.</p>","<p><strong>What was the most challenging part of playing Johnnie Cochran?</strong></p>","<p>The most challengingÂ part was figuringÂ out how I was going to approach it.Â I did a play, âMy Children, My Africa,â years ago, and I knew nothing about South Africa, the dialect to do.Â I didnât know how to begin.Â How much research do you do?Â How do you find your way in?Â Whatâs the first thing to attack?Â How do you cut it down to size?Â How do you make it manageable so youâre not overwhelmed?Â Johnnie CochranÂ is an overwhelming kind of guy.Â So I just began with his life.Â I just read as much IÂ could, beginning with the Jeffrey ToobinÂ book and found other books about him,Â what people saidÂ about him and what he said about himself.Â So then when I got into the arena, when I got into the cage of the courtroom,Â I hadÂ all the homework done and just let it flow, because heâs in me.Â I know him.</p>","<p><strong>What did you learn about him through your research?</strong></p>","<p>I learned he was an amazingly wonderful and beautifully flawed human being.Â I didnâtÂ know him at all.Â I went to his house years ago for a party with my wifeÂ andÂ I was in awe, like we all were. I just heard all the wonderful thingsÂ he did, not only for O.J. andÂ Michael Jackson but for common people, folks who needed someone to fight for them.Â I was impressed with his work against police brutality.Â He became well versed in the area.Â So when it became time for him to come on the O.J. trial, there was no better person to be there.Â He knew it better than anyone.Â He knew what was at stake.Â He knew the game had to be elevated.Â He knew why there had to be an African-AmericanÂ jury and he fought for it.Â If Marcia Clark had fought for the trial to be in Santa Monica, the trial would have taken a different direction. But she didnât know, she didnât understand. BecauseÂ it was a black man and a white woman,Â thereâs a deep history there.Â Everybody takes sides when it comes down to that.Â When she was going on about the domestic abuse, black women would just sit there and go, <em>uh huh</em>. It defies logic,Â but she didnât understand.Â Johnnie understood.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p><strong>In some ways, the case was almost over before it started, thanks to some of the strategies that Johnnie was able to see right away and implement. </strong></p>","<p>So much so. It was over at the start because of what Marcia and the prosecution didnât do. They should have fought to have the case moved. But it didnât matter. Even if you had it in a makeshift tent â do not have in downtown [L.A.]. Do not have a black jury. Fight for a white jury. But she didnât do it.</p>","<p>The prosecution didnât know that race trumps everything. Even when they were listening to all the points that she was making about domestic abuse, the jury was listening to her and they were [not necessarily receptive]. They were thinking, âA white woman â she was with our man.â</p>","<p><strong>Itâs sad when Marcia says, âBlack women love me.â </strong></p>","<p>But in her past, they did. They absolutely loved her. But she had never had a case like this, when you have a celebrity hero who is the monster. How do you get people to not see the celebrity and see the monster?</p>","<p><strong>What surprised you as you did your research?</strong></p>","<p>It all surprised me.Â I knew nothing. I didnât know [Judge Lance] Ito was such a celebrity hound.Â Imagine what kind of case this would have been if you didnât have a judge who wanted it to be onÂ television?Â Can you imagine what the trial would have been?Â CNN wouldnât be what it is today. It wouldnât have been the big deal it became becauseÂ it was on TVÂ for a year solid.Â Itâs a lot for a whole world to chew on for a year. Weâre still chewing on it.</p>","<p><strong>Did it change your opinion of the case?</strong></p>","<p>I didnâtÂ follow it [back then]; I was just at the Bronco chase and the verdict.Â All I knew was I was so pleased that after 400 years that an African-American had worked the system in the biggest stage in the world.Â And a black man got off because the system was worked, the legal system was worked.Â Was justice served? I donât know.Â Two people were murdered. If not O.J., who?Â In that sense, no, justice was not served.Â But we saw that we as African-Americans had to live for 400 years with all the many indignities.Â Thatâs why African-Americans were cheering.Â They werenât cheering for O.J.,Â because O.J. didnât really have a sense of black people at all.Â He said, âIâm not black, Iâm O.J.â It wasnât about him. He just happened toÂ be the vehicleÂ for which everyone had their own opinion. And because it was on TVÂ for all to see,Â everyone had one.</p>","<p><strong>Sometimes race will come up as a topic in popular culture, but then it will go away again. As a culture, so often we engage in â¦ </strong></p>","<p>Amnesia.</p>","<p><strong>Because itâs more comfortable to just let it go away again. TV has been a part of process of repetitive amnesia. Itâs not enough to talk about it or deal with it periodically. The people with power need to do something about it. </strong></p>","<p>But we donât do anything in this country until itâs an emergency. We donât really look 20 or 30 or 40 years ahead and put a plan into place. We donât do that.</p>","<p><strong>So often, real change is hard to come by. </strong></p>","<p>People donât do anything unless itâs an emergency, because itâs uncomfortable. We know that we need to do something about our consumption of gasoline and that we need to switch to wind power or solar. But itâs about money. Nobody wants to give up [the status quo]. Thereâs money to be made in confusion, thereâs money to be made in all these oil companies. And eventually when thereâs a tragedy, when the gas starts to run out, then weâll start to do it. But by then, itâs too late.</p>","<p>Thatâs what all these incidents that are happening are trying to tell us â âPay attention.â How does it happen that a young man [Chicagoâs Laquan McDonald] was shot 16 times a year and a half ago â and weâre just finding out about it? The mayor can explain all he wants to about how he didnât know and there were extenuating circumstances. You had the information. Itâs like Flint and the water. Same thing. If it was white folks, they would have tested the water first, because you knew they would be on you to do that. But because itâs black folks, âAh, it doesnât matter. Itâs just them. They wonât push back. We can save money. Just do it.â</p>","<p><strong>What was the experience like on-set?</strong></p>","<p>One of the challenges we all had was working with four or fiveÂ cameras at the same time.Â Watching the piece you notice how the camerasÂ are continually moving in and out.Â That is very distracting as an actor.Â There are five cameras around your face in a close-up.Â They are everywhere, getting your coverage.Â We sometimes shot three scenes in a row.Â We just changed clothes and kept shooting.Â You have to have a certain kind of actor who can work like that.Â Where am I now?Â Whoâs speaking?Â OK, letâs go!Â We donât have time to play.</p>","<p><strong>How did you handle it?</strong></p>","<p>When I first saw those cameras in my face,Â I just fell apart.Â When they turned on me and started swirling in front of my face, Â I wasnât ready.Â I didnât know the scene well enough to let them do whatever they wanted to do.Â I couldnât maintain my focus.Â That was very disheartening.Â I said the next time Iâll be ready and I was.</p>","<p><strong>It must have been a bonding experience for the cast.</strong></p>","<p>We all recognized what we were up against.Â Everybody had their own private Idaho.Â Everybody had their own private challenges.Â And consequentlyÂ we all had to be supportive because then it was going to be theirÂ turn to be up there with the camerasÂ swirling.Â We all were very respectful of what we were all doing.Â We recognizedÂ the importance of this journey we were embarking on.Â It was going to require all of us to workÂ together.Â None of us could work in isolation.Â It was a massive gig.Â If you donât want to do theÂ work to make that live and sing then you shouldnât be in that hot kitchen.Â All of us wanted to be in there.Â We went through the war together and we came out victorious.</p>","<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Did you have a favorite day of the shoot? </b></span></p>","<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It maybe was the closing [arguments]. I didnât get a whole lot of time to prep for it. [Originally] I had less than a day to prepare. The closing argument was maybe three pages. I jammed it in my head, and said, âIâm just going to have to get up there and make the best of it.â I went last â I was third. </span></p>","<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By the time they got to me, they ran out of time. So they said, âWe wonât be able to get back to it until Tuesday,â and it was Thursday. So I said, âNow Iâll be able to get it down.â By the time Tuesday came around, I was ready. </span><span class=\"s1\">I got four extra days to prep. </span></p>","<p><strong>Why do you think audiences are responding to the series?</strong></p>","<p>Because we really havenât dealt with it.Â We keep going around the same bend.Â When thereâs an opportunityÂ to strike a blow to racism and sexism, we tend to pretend like itâs fine, thereâs no problem. But thereâs absolutely a problem becauseÂ we keep butting our heads against it. Weâll get it, I think. Shooting a young man 16 times. Eventually weâre going to go, thatâs enough. The entire world is watching. Weâre preaching democracy throughout the world. They see what weâre doing and how weâre struggling. Itâs very important that we deal with this.</p>","<p><em>âThe People v. O.J.
