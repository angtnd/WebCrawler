nine other destinations in the communist island, restoring regular air travel for the first time in more than 50 years.</p>","<p>Once the accord is signed, US authorities will immediately invite American airlines to submit applications to operate the flights, with routes to be set up in a matter of months, officials said.</p>","<p>Additionally, the Cuban government will give \"thorough consideration to future requests from the US government to increase this level of service,\" US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Transportation Affairs Thomas Engle said.</p>","<p>\"The two governments reaffirm their commitment to strengthen their already close cooperation in aviation safety and security matters.\"</p>","<p>- Multiple destinations -</p>","<p>Terms of the agreement allow for regular flights \"between any city in the US and any city in Cuba,\" provided it is equipped with proper infrastructure for international flights, he added.</p>","<p>The United States announced plans to resume the flights in December, on the one-year anniversary of the start of reconciliation between Washington and Havana.</p>","<p>Under the new arrangement, airlines in the two countries can now strike deals in such areas as code-sharing and aircraft leasing, the Cuban embassy said at the time.</p>","<p>However, tourist travel is still barred under the trade embargo that the United States slapped on Cuba in 1960 after Fidel Castro came to power in a revolution.</p>","<p>The US Treasury Department has, however, set 12 categories of authorized travel.</p>","<p>\"Initially, the US carriers will be allowed to fly 20 scheduled frequencies per day to Havana, the largest market, and remember that the current level is zero,\" Engle said.</p>","<p>\"And also allowed to fly 10 scheduled frequencies per day to any other city in Cuba that has an airport open to international service.\"</p>","<p>Besides Havana, flights will be allowed to Camaguey, Cayo Coco, Cayo Largo, Cienfuegos, Holguin, Manzanillo, Matanzas, Santa Clara and Santiago de Cuba.</p>","<p>Although the understanding formally opens the door for Cubana airlines to operate future flights into the United States, none are allowed to arrive at present.</p>","<p>- Call for applications -</p>","<p>Deputy Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs Brandon Belford said Cuban airlines will still have to obtain their own licenses from US authorities such as the Treasury Department and Office of Foreign Assets Control.</p>","<p>\"So we do not anticipate Cuban-owned aircraft serving the US in the near future,\" he said.</p>","<p>Later on Tuesday, the Treasury Department will invite US airlines to submit applications for allocation of the new frequencies.</p>","<p>Belford said \"carriers will have 15 days to submit their applications if they want to serve Havana and the other nine airports.\"</p>","<p>All final decisions will be made in approximately half a year.</p>","<p>\"Our expectation is that we will be in position to make a decision and make it final sometime in the summer, in terms of which carriers and which US cities will have service into Cuba,\" Belford said.</p>","<p>Commercial flights between Cuba and the United States were cancelled 53 years ago but since the mid-1970s authorized charter flights have been allowed under certain conditions.</p>","<p>The United States and Cuba formally restored diplomatic relations in July and re-opened embassies in each other's

But in a 20-minute speech, the elder Bush repeatedly alluded to the business mogul and former reality star whose insurgent candidacy has thrown the GOP race into turmoil, urging voters to choose a candidate who offers more than slogans and who can appeal across party lines in order to win the general election in November. </p>","<p> âAll of the sloganeering and all of the talk doesnât matter if we donât win,â George W. Bush said. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> The former presidentâs appearance came just days before Saturdayâs pivotal South Carolina GOP primary, which could be make or break for Jeb Bushâs struggling presidential bid. After losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, the former Florida governor trails badly in the polls here â well behind Trump, who has a 20-point lead over his closest rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. According to many polls, Bush is running in fifth place, behind Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. </p>","<p> But Bush aides hoped to spark a comeback for their boss by bringing in the former president, who remains incredibly popular here seven years after leaving office â particularly with veterans and members of the military, who make up a significant part of the stateâs Republican electorate. </p>","<p> Itâs a change in strategy for Jeb Bush, who has not always embraced his family legacy on the campaign trail. Since declaring his bid for the GOP nomination, the former Florida governor has struggled to deal with his brotherâs complicated political legacy, including his handling of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. </p>","<p> Last year, Jeb Bush stumbled over questions about whether he would have handled the Iraq war differently â torn between acknowledging the mistakes made by the former presidentâs administration and staying loyal to his brother. When rivals pounced on that and the idea that yet another Bush might be in the White House, Jeb Bush argued, âIâm my own man.â </p>","<p> More recently, Trump has tried to make George W. Bush an issue in the campaign â arguing at Saturdayâs GOP debate that he should have been impeached for his handling of the Iraq War. He has also repeatedly questioned whether George W. Bush kept the country safe, pointing out that âthe World Trade Center came down during his reign.â </p>","<p> But with little to lose, Jeb Bush seems willing to accept the political risks of embracing his brother on the campaign trail â especially in South Carolina, which has been central to the political successes of the Bush family. George H.W. Bush won the 1992 GOP primary here on his way to becoming the nationâs 41stÂ president. And in 2000, Republicans here revived George W. Bushâs bid for the presidency, handing him a decisive victory just days after a blowout loss to Arizona Sen. John McCain in New Hampshire. </p>","<p> As he took the stage in North Charleston, Bush, grayer and a little heavier than his last appearance on the campaign trail, was met with thunderous applause and screams as he and his wife, Laura, joined Jeb Bush on the stage. âThis is Bush country,â Sen. Lindsey Graham, who introduced the former president, declared. </p>","<p> Until Monday, Bush had pointedly stayed off the political stage. But as soon as he took to the podium, he reverted back to the Dubya of old â charming voters with his folksy one-liners and easy charm. (At one point, he spoke of his presidentialÂ âafterlife.âÂ âWeâve become tree farmers,â he said.Â âIt gives me time to practice my stump speech.â)</p>","<p>It was a sharp contrast to Jeb Bush, who often comes across as awkward and stiff on the stump. (There had been some concern in the Bush campaign that an appearance on the stump by the former president, with his natural political talents, could overshadow Jeb.)</p>","<p> <b> </b> </p>","<p> But George W. Bush defended his brotherâs style, repeatedly emphasizing his quiet and steady leadership as governor of Florida and as a candidate for the White House. Again and again, he spoke of the need to have a president who is âcalmâ and chooses his words carefully. </p>","<p> âStrength is not empty rhetoric,â the elder Bush said. âIt is not bluster, it is not theatrics. Real strength, strength of purpose, comes from integrity and character.â </p>","<p> âIn my experience,â the former president added, âthe strongest person usually isnât the loudest one in the room.â </p>","<p> Behind him, Jeb Bush politely applauded. </p>"]},"property":"politics","images":[{"caption":"Brothers in arms:Â George W.

In the last years of the Reagan administration, Robert Bork was rejected and Kennedy was overwhelmingly accepted by a Senate also controlled by Democrats.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Since World War II, there have been 38 official nominees for the Supreme Court. Eight of those nominations were withdrawn, not voted on or rejected by the Senate.</p>","<p>Of the 30 successful confirmations since 1945, 13 of the votes, or about 43 percent, came when the Presidentâs party didnât control the Senate. This was especially true when the Democrats ran the Senate for long periods during the 1960s and 1970s.</p>","<p>In fact, all 13 of the Supreme Court nominations since 1945 that were eventually approved by an opposing party in the Senate were made by Republican Presidents. Familiar names such as Earl Warren, William Brennan and Potter Stewart were Eisenhower nominees approved by a Democrat-controlled Senate.</p>","<p>When President Eisenhower nominated Warren as Chief Justice in January 1954, the Democrats briefly controlled the Senate by one vote, but Warrenâs nomination was easily approved in a voice vote. Eisenhower nominees like Stewart and John Harlan II also passed easily, getting at least 70 yes votes from the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p>","<p>But the past three Supreme Court nominees to be rejected in a Senate vote were also candidates proposed by a Republican President to a Democrat-majority Senate. Richard Nixon saw two nominees, Clement Haynsworth and Harold Carswell, get just 45 yes votes in the Senate (the GOP had 44 Senators at the time).</p>","<p>The well-publicized nomination of Bork to the Supreme Court by President Reagan in 1987 saw Bork get just 42 votes in the Senate, when the Republicans had just 45 seats.</p>","<p>Not surprisingly, in every instance since 1945 when the same party controlled the White House and the Senate, that nominee was approved. (There were two nominees in the Lyndon Johnson administration who didnât make it to the voting stage in the Senate, partially due to a Republican filibuster.)</p>","<p>So what has happened when a Democrat in the White House asked a Republican-controlled Senate to approve a Supreme Court nominee? That is a rarity, because Democratic presidents such as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter mostly dealt with a Senate controlled by their own party.</p>","<p>You have to go back to December 1895, when a Senate with a plurality of Republicans approved President Grover Clevelandâs nomination of Rufus Peckham to the Supreme Court in a voice vote. At that time, the Republicans had 44 Senate seats and the Democrats had 40 seats, with 6 other Senators belonging to other parties. (The Republican-controlled Senate during Clevelandâs first term in 1888 also approved two other nominees from the Democratic president: Melville Fuller and Lucius Lamar.)</p>","<p>In recent years, though, Presidents have made it a point to put up Supreme Court nominees when their party controlled the votes in the Senate. Since the Thomas nomination in 1991, the past six Supreme Court Justices won confirmation when the Presidentâs party also controlled the Senate.</p>","<p>President Bill Clinton only had a Democratic-controlled Senate for his first two years in office, but he was able to get Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer confirmed in 1993 and 1994. President George W. Bush won his nomination battles for John Roberts and Samuel Alito, while President Barack Obama saw successful votes for Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.</p>","<p><strong>Recent Stories on

And thatâs just wrong.â</p><p>How serious is the problem? Bloomberg News had store-bought grated cheese tested for wood-pulp content by an independent laboratory.</p><p>Cellulose is a safe additive, and an acceptable level is 2 percent to 4 percent, according to Dean Sommer, a cheese technologist at the Center for Dairy Research in Madison, Wisconsin. Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese, from Jewel-Osco, was 8.8 percent cellulose, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc.âs Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese registered 7.8 percent, according to test results. Whole Foods 365 brand didnât list cellulose as an ingredient on the label, but still tested at 0.3 percent. Kraft had 3.8 percent.</p><p>More from Bloomberg.com: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-15/buffalo-valued-at-record-11-1-million-in-auction-beeld-says?cmpid=yhoo.hosted\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">World's Most Expensive African Buffalo Valued at $11.1 Million</a></p><p>âWe remain committed to the quality of our products,â Michael Mullen, a Kraft Heinz Co. spokesman, said in an e-mail. John Forrest Ales, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said he questioned the reliability of testing a single sample and thatÂ Wal-Martâs âcompliance team is looking into these findings.â</p><p>Jewel-Osco is also investigating, spokeswoman Mary Frances Trucco said in an e-mail. âWe pride ourselves on the quality of products we deliver for our customers,â Trucco said.</p><p>âWe strongly believe that there is no cellulose present,â Blaire Kniffin, a Whole Foods Market Inc. spokeswoman, said in an e-mail, adding that it could have been a false positive. âBut we are investigating this matter.â</p><p>According to the FDAâs report on Castle, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, âno parmesan cheese was used to manufactureâ the Market Pantry brand 100% grated Parmesan Cheese, sold at Target Corp. stores, and Always Save Grated Parmesan Cheese and Best Choice 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese, sold by Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc., which along with its subsidiaries supplies 3,400 retail stores in 30 states. Instead, there was a mixture of Swiss, mozzarella, white cheddar and cellulose, according to the FDA.</p><p>Castle has never been an authorized Target vendor, according to Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder. âWe are investigating the information provided in the report,â she said in an e-mail. Jeff Pedersen, an executive vice president of Associated Wholesale Grocers, had no comment.</p><p>DairiConcepts, a Springfield, Missouri-based cheese maker thatâs a subsidiary of Dairy Farmers of America, said on its website that in a test of 28 brands, only one-third of label claims about protein levels in grated parmesan were accurate. The company blamed fillers such asÂ cellulose.</p><p>Until recently, there was little incentive to follow labeling rules. Criminal cases are rare. Thatâs because the FDA, which enforces the countryâs food laws, prioritizes health hazards, said John Spink, director of the Food Fraud Initiative at Michigan State University. But civil lawsuits abound. A Jan. 29 complaint accuses McDonaldâs Corp. of selling pure mozzarella sticks that contain starch, considered a filler, a claim the company denies.</p><p>Cheese makers commit adulteration because it saves money.</p><p>Marty Wilson, chief executive officer of New York-based Sugar Foods, which buys cheese from Schuman and supplies major pizza chains with to-go packets of parmesan, said whenever his contracts come up for renewal, competitors peddling ersatz cheeses surface. And he has lost business to them. âWeâre constantly battling cheap imitators across all of our product lines,â Wilson said.</p><p>Bob Greco of Cheese Merchants of America said competitors hawking bastardized products have underbid him by as much as 30 percent. âThe bad guys win and the rule-followers lose,â Greco said.</p><p>The FDA regulates what can legally be called Parmesan or Romano according to standards established in the 1950s to ensure that manufacturers wouldnât sell cheeses wildly different in composition.</p><p>Americans love their hard Italian cheeses. Last year, U.S. Parmesan output rose 11 percent from 2014 to around 336 million pounds, while Romano production grew 20 percent, to 54 million pounds, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.</p><p>Italian producers, however, arenât loving it as much. The Parmigiano Reggiano Consortium, a trade group based in Rome, <a href=\"http://www.parmigianoreggiano.com/press_area/2015_1/italian_sounding_thirds_consumers_deceived_battle.aspx\" title=\"Link to Consortium Site\" data-web-url=\"http://www.parmigianoreggiano.com/press_area/2015_1/italian_sounding_thirds_consumers_deceived_battle.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"_mce_temp_anchor\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">asked</a> the European Union in December to protect its manufacturers against U.S. companies that were using the names of their cheeses and Italian flags on their packaging. âA deceitâ is how the organizationâs president, Giuseppe Alai, characterized Americansâ use of Italian names and symbols.</p><p>Of all the popular cheeses in the U.S., the hard Italian varieties are the most likely to have fillers because of their expense. Parmesan wheels sit in curing rooms for months, losing moisture, which results in a smaller yield than other cheeses offer. While 100 pounds of milk might produce 10 pounds of cheddar, it makes only eight pounds of Parmesan. That two-pound difference means millions of dollars to manufacturers, according to Sommer.</p><p>Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania-based Castle produced mainly imitation cheeses for nearly 30 years. The company, whose factory was adorned with crenelated battlements and curved archways to look like a medieval castle, had $19 million in sales in 2013.</p><p>The trouble started in 2010 when it began making what it called 100 percent grated Parmesan. A plant manager designed flawed recipes, and after Castle fired him in 2012, he alerted the FDA, the company said in a December 2012 letter to the agency, obtained through the FOIA.</p><p>The FDA accused Castle Cheese of marketing as real grated Parmesan what was in factÂ a mixture of imitation cheese and trimmings of Swiss, white cheddar, Havarti and mozzarella. After the probe, Castle stopped production of the problematic cheeses and dumped inventories. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2014.</p><p>A lawyer for Michelle Myrter and Castle Cheese didnât respond to requests for comment. In the 2012 letter to the FDA, Castle said there was inadequate documentation, and the FDA could note only the potential that the products werenât 100 percent pure.</p><p>Lauren E.

Why send one group to shake down a terrified outpost when you can send two? Leave one in the background in case the sheep get any delusions of grandeur. It would be perfectly in line for there to have been more Saviors around the bend as backup. We also know the season finale of <i>The Walking Dead</i> shook the actors up pretty bad.

But Glennâs many run-ins with death are beginning to feel like a red herring. The AMC show has deviated from the source material in the past and âÂ if that car wasnât an accident â why would Negan pick a random member of The Group when the man who killed his scouting party is right there? The leader of the Saviors is not a forgiving man.</p>","<p>On top of that, rumors were flying last year that Norman Reedus was selling his Atlanta home.
