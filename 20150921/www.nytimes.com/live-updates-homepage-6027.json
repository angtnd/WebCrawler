(The red carpet gets going at around 6 p.m.)\n\nTrue to Emmy form, viewers can expect many of the same nominees as last year (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/07\/17\/arts\/television\/emmy-nominations-2015-list.html\">see the full list<\/a>), though rule changes have reconfigured the nomination pool somewhat. The changes were designed to more clearly define categories, and keep producers from gaming the system by putting their shows and stars in less competitive ones. For example, anthology shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and mini-series will be considered in the limited series category, and the guest acting nominations are limited to performers who made brief appearances in shows. \n\nThe TV Academy also raised the number of nominations in the top series awards from six to seven, and split the variety category into separate ones for talk and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/09\/18\/arts\/television\/emmy-nominations-2015-sketch-comedy-videos.html\">sketch series<\/a>. Finally, the new rules expanded the pool of voters, perhaps adding some unpredictability to the results.\n\nThis year\u2019s Emmy Awards could offer a final hurrah for AMC\u2019s \u201cMad Men,\u201d new prestige for Amazon and streaming services, a coronation for Amy Schumer and some actual history, as Viola Davis and Taraji P. Henson vie to become the first African-American actress to win the top drama award.\n\nBut for many viewers, this year\u2019s Emmy intrigue amounts to a single question: Will Jon Hamm finally win? \n\n\nHis portrayal of Don Draper on \u201cMad Men\u201d has been one of the most indelible characters on television. But while he\u2019s been nominated for best actor in a drama for each season of \u201cMad Men\u201d since the show\u2019s debut in 2007, he\u2019s never won. In fact, no \u201cMad Men\u201d performer has ever won an acting Emmy, though the show has been named best drama four times.\n\n\u201cMad Men\u201d ended in May, so this is the last chance for all of them. But as the face of the show, Mr. Hamm\u2019s shutout is the most striking. For years he had the misfortune of sharing a category with Bryan Cranston of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d who was named best actor four times, including last year. But with \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d ending in 2013, the path is clear for Mr. Hamm to finally take home an award. (For his career, including nominations for other roles and as a producer, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emmys.com\/bios\/jon-hamm\">Mr. Hamm is 0 for 16 at the Emmy Awards<\/a>.) Potential spoilers include Bob Odenkirk, the star of the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d spin-off \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d and Jeff Daniels, who won the award in 2013 for \u201cThe Newsroom.\u201d\n\nAnother \u201cMad Men\u201d actor, Elisabeth Moss, is nominated for best lead actress in a drama. But that race is shaping up as a potentially historic contest between Ms. Davis, for ABC\u2019s \u201cHow To Get Away With Murder,\u201d and Ms. Henson, for \u201cEmpire\u201d on Fox. Ms. Henson, in particular, created one of the most unforgettable characters on television this season in Cookie Lyon, the flamboyant matriarch of a music business dynasty. Her nomination is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/emmy-nominations-2015\/critics-notebook-snubs-and-surprises\/\">the only one \u201cEmpire\u201d received in a major category<\/a>, even though the soapy drama was arguably the year\u2019s breakout hit, in terms of both ratings and buzz.\n\nOn the comedy side, the ABC sitcom \u201cModern Family\u201d has been named best comedy five years in a row. Few would be surprised if it happened again. But this year it faces serious competition from the acclaimed \u201cTransparent,\u201d the 2014 Amazon series about a gender-transitioning patriarch and his family.\n\nA win for \u201cTransparent\u201d would be a boon for Amazon and for streaming in general \u2014 no streaming-first show has won a top series Emmy award.\n\nThe emotionally complex and often dramatic \u201cTransparent\u201d is listed in the comedy category thanks, in part, to a new Emmy rule that, with rare exceptions, classifies 30-minute shows as comedies and hour-long ones as dramas. (\u201cOrange In the New Black,\u201d a comedy at the Emmys last year, is in the drama category this time for the same reason.) If voters decide \u201cTransparent\u201d isn\u2019t blatantly humorous enough to win best comedy \u2014 or if they decide a win for star Jeffrey Tambor in the best actor category is sufficient praise \u2014 \u201cVeep,\u201d the HBO political satire starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a beleaguered president, could win. Mrs. Louis-Dreyfus has been named the best actress in a comedy three years in a row.\n\nAnother comedienne could put a cap on a stellar year with an Emmy win. Amy Schumer\u2019s Comedy Central sketch show won raves for its third season, and feels like the favorite in the newly created variety sketch category. The expansion acknowledges the innovative sketch shows that have emerged in recent years \u2014 other contenders for the award include \u201cKey & Peele,\u201d which ended in September after five seasons of adroitly blending wacky jokes with sly racial commentary, and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which celebrated its 40th anniversary this year.\n\nThe traditional variety show category reflects the transition currently remaking late-night comedy. While final seasons can turn outgoing shows into sentimental favorites, how will voters respond when half of the nominated variety shows \u2014  \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d \u201cThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart\u201d and \u201cLate Show With David Letterman\u201d \u2014 no longer exist? Will they opt instead for the new ratings king, Jimmy Fallon, or the hot host du jour, John Oliver? Which will win out, hipness or nostalgia?\n\nThe answer to this and all other Emmy questions will be revealed tonight.","parent":{"ID":6027,"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/emmys-2015\/","title":"Emmys 2015: Live Updates","prettytime":"Sep 20, 2015 8:43 pm","datetime":"2015-09-20 20:43:25","timestamp":1442796205,"tags":["winners"],"admin_limit":-1,"fe_limit":15,"status":"publish","quicktags":[{"b_id":"1013","nicename":"jon-caramanica","display_name":"Jon Caramanica"},{"b_id":"430","nicename":"dave-itzkoff","display_name":"Dave Itzkoff"}],"bylines":["The New York Times"],"keywords":["Emmy Awards","Hamm, Jon"]},"date":"2015-09-20T09:14:51","modified":"2015-09-20T20:44:03","slug":"emmys-2015-what-to-expect-at-this-years-ceremony","guid":"346-emmys-2015-what-to-expect-at-this-years-ceremony-6160","excerpt":"","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America\/New_York","date_gmt":"2015-09-20T13:14:51","modified_tz":"America\/New_York","modified_gmt":"2015-09-21T00:44:03","meta":{"links":[]},"relative_time":"11H ago","prettytime":"Sep 20, 2015 9:14 am ET","timestamp":"9:14 am ET","datestamp":"Sep 20, 2015","time":1442754891,"link":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/emmys-2015\/emmys-2015-what-to-expect-at-this-years-ceremony\/","shortlink":["http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1KZe1YU"],"admin_link":"http:\/\/live-admin.em.nytimes.com\/emmys-2015\/emmys-2015-what-to-expect-at-this-years-ceremony\/","authors":[{"b_id":"2493","image":{"full":"","50":"","75":""},"twitter":"","facebook":"","email":"jegner@nytimes.com","website":"http:\/\/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com\/author\/jeremy-egner\/","scoop_id":"2962","title_case_name":"","name":"Jeremy Egner","slug":"jeremy-egner"}],"content_expanded":"<div class=\"w592\"><figure class=\"media photo promo\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemid=\"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/05\/18\/arts\/mm-hamm\/mm-hamm-tmagArticle.jpg\" itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/ImageObject\" role=\"group\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo<\/span><div class=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/emmys-2015\/emmys-2015-what-to-expect-at-this-years-ceremony\/\"><img itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/05\/18\/arts\/mm-hamm\/mm-hamm-tmagArticle.jpg\" src=\"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/05\/18\/arts\/mm-hamm\/mm-hamm-tmagArticle.jpg\" id=\"100000003690907\" width=\"592\" height=\"384\" alt=\"Jon Hamm in the series finale of \u201cMad Men.\u201d\"   \/><\/a><meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"384\"><meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"592\"><\/div><figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"description\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Jon Hamm in the series finale of \u201cMad Men.\u201d<\/span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit<\/span> Michael Yarish\/AMC<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The 67th prime time Emmy Awards will take place Sunday night in Los Angeles, bringing television\u2019s top performers, technicians and creators together for a night of self-congratulation and ceremony, and perhaps the occasional funny song from the host, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/09\/18\/arts\/television\/andy-samberg-emmy-awards-2015.html\">Andy Samberg<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Fox will broadcast the awards show live, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.
