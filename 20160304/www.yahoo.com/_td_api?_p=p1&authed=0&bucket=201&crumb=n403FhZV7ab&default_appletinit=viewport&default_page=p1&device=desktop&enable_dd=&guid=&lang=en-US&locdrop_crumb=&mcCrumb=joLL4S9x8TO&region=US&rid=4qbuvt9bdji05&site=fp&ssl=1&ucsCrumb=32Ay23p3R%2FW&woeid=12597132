In a brokered or contested convention, a nominee is chosen through multiple rounds of voting by delegates from all 50 states and six U.S. territories.</p>","<p>Marco Rubioâs campaign is looking ahead at that possibility and hopes that by openly discussing the arcane mechanics of how voting delegates are selected to the convention, it can defang the Trump-backersâ argument to some degree.</p>","<p>Trump supporters will be enraged if Trump wins the most states and delegates but falls short of the 1,237-delegate threshold needed to secure the nomination, and then loses during balloting at a contested convention.</p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/yahoo-politics/other-candidates-theyll-support-trump-043009357.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>"],"remaining_body":["<p>But Rubioâs campaign is already stressing that if such an outcome occurs, it will be the result of a multistep process that is not a secret to anyone. But the state-by-state system of selecting delegates does showcase the fact that to the extent that any real GOP establishment exists in the modern era, itâs at the less-high-profile state and county levels. A brokered convention would come down to the votes of thousands of little-known local party officials with a deep commitment to the well-being of the Republican Party.</p>","<p>âIf Donald Trump can get to 1,237 delegates, heâll be the nominee and weâll shut up,â said a Rubio ally helping to plan for the convention but not authorized by the campaign to talk openly about the process.</p>","<p>But if Trump cannot get that number and has to face a brokered convention, the reply to Trumpâs supporters will be: âThemâs the rules.â</p>","<p>Of course, the more that Trumpâs rivals can actually win states rather than come in second or third in them, the less they will need to rely on an argument about the rules in July at the convention in Cleveland.</p>","<p>But if Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, or Ohio Gov. John Kasich all stay in and do well enough to amass a substantial number of delegates of their own and Trump cannot reach the 1,237-delegate threshold, then the convention will be deadlocked and will have to go to multiple ballots, or votes.</p>","<p>âItâs going to be the most exciting time,â <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/john-kasich-ohio-220189\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">said Kasich Thursday</a>, noting that if he wins Ohio there likely will have to be a brokered convention.</p>","<p>Mitt Romney, the GOPâs 2012 nominee, advocated Thursday that the Republican candidates adopt an explicit strategy of splitting the vote between Rubio, Cruz and Kasich in order to block Trump from winning the nomination before the convention. </p>","<p>âGiven the current delegate selection process, that means that Iâd vote for Marco Rubio in Florida and for John Kasich in Ohio and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state,â Romney said in a high profile speech at the University of Utah in which he flayed Trump as a âphonyâ and a âfraud.â</p>","<p>Some news organizations reported an effort by Romney lieutenants to organize an anti-Trump effort at the convention. But an attempt to mastermind some kind of overarching convention plot underestimates the complexity of each stateâs process of selecting delegates â and how much national organizational work it would take to influence it.</p>","<p>On the first ballot at a brokered convention, delegates from all states except Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and a few from Louisiana must vote for the candidate who won their support on the day of their stateâs primary or caucus.</p>","<p>But on the second ballot, âThatâs when the action gets really interesting,â the Rubio supporter said. Thatâs when 55 percent of a stateâs delegates will be free to vote for whomever they want.</p>","<p>By the third ballot, 85 percent of all the delegates will be free agents.<br /></p>","<p>At that point, the <a href=\"http://www.thegreenpapers.com/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">2,472 delegates</a> on the floor of the convention would become major political players whose loyalties would decide the nomination. And the process by which those delegates were chosen will come under a microscope.</p>","<p>Each state is different. <a href=\"http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/IA-R\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Take Iowa for example</a>, the first state to vote in the primary cycle. On Feb. 1, Iowa held caucuses in which Republican voters wrote down the name of their choice for president on pieces of paper. But that night each precinct also chose delegates to a convention for their local county.</p>","<p>A week from Saturday, on March 12, each of Iowaâs 99 counties will hold conventions, where they will elect delegates to two more conventions. First, the counties will vote on delegates who will attend a congressional district convention. There are four districts in the Hawkeye State, and on April 9Â each will hold a convention to elect three delegates to the national convention.</p>","<p>The county conventions also elect delegates to a statewide convention, to be held on May 21. At that convention, delegates will vote again, to elect 15 more delegates to the national convention.</p>","<p>Iowa sends 30 delegates to the national convention in all: 12 from the congressional district conventions, 15 from the state convention, and then the three last slots are filled by the stateâs GOP party chairman and its two members of the Republican National Committee.</p>","<p>Now, take the complexity and the unique local flavor of that process, and multiply it by 56.</p>","<p>The result is that convention delegates are people who are deeply plugged into small relational networks in their communities and states. The time and effort they put into doing the work of running their local party year in and year out is rewarded by a trip to the national convention every four years.</p>","<p>âI donât think Trump is that well situated to participate in this process,â said the Rubio ally. âThese are people who have done this for many years, oftentimes under the direction of their Republican governor.â</p>","<p>âOf course, there may be others who are trying to wrestle away control of the state party,â he added.</p>","<p>Ben Ginsberg, a veteran Republican lawyer who is an expert on the nominating rules, said that Trumpâs campaign is certain to organize its own slates of delegates in as many states as possible.</p>","<p>âI also think the Trump people understand the state-by-state need to organize the state conventions and the state executive committees,â <a href=\"http://on.msnbc.com/1oSh3EJ\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Ginsberg said Thursday</a> on MSNBC.</p>","<p>Up until the 1960s, delegates were largely controlled by party bosses from the major cities and from Washington, who gathered at the convention to decide the nominee.

She noted that though most felt she had nothing to lose against Rousey, who was such an overwhelming favorite, she still felt the pressure to perform to not let her coaches, teammates, family and friends down.</p>","<p>And she has a similar motivation for Saturday's bout. She's heard so much about Rousey â from the time last August when their bout was announced to this week â that she's just about done talking about it.</p>","<p>A reporter asked Holm Wednesday following a brief public workout when she thought the incessant questions about Rousey would end. She sighed and said, \"I guess I should be asking you that.\"</p>","<p>Holm acknowledged that Tate is, in some ways, a more difficult match for her because of the style differences.</p>","<p>But the pressure is clearly building.

She wants to win for a host of reasons, but mostly because she doesn't want to be remembered as the Buster Douglas of women's MMA. She doesn't want to feel like an interloper in the champion's circle, and a win over a high-quality veteran like Tate will legitimize her reign.</p>","<p>Douglas stunned Mike Tyson, then the undisputed heavyweight champion, in 1990, knocking him out in the 10th round after a one-sided fight that many historians regard as the biggest upset in boxing history. But in his first title defense, Douglas, the career underachiever, lost his belt in three rounds to Evander Holyfield.</p>","<p>Never again did he win a significant bout.</p>","<p>That's certainly not a fate Holm wants for herself.</p>","<p>\"I don't want to be a one-hit wonder,\" she said.</p>","<p>If she gets past Tate, she'll likely, though not definitely, fight Rousey next. Rousey has indicated she'll be ready to fight in the November time frame, and Holm may not be content to wait that long.</p>","<p>She wants to be a fighting champion, and if she gets past Tate, she may choose to defend against someone like Amanda Nunes, who meets Valentina Shevchenko on Saturday's undercard.</p>","<p>The question that confronts the winner of Saturday's bout is the quality of the division she'll rule.</p>","<p>Rousey faced those questions because, after beating so many opponents so quickly, some people felt it had to be because the quality of the opposition was so weak.</p>","<p>Holm's dismantling of Rousey should have put an end to that, but the question remains: Outside of Tate and Rousey, and perhaps Cat Zingano and Nunes, who else in the division is capable of competing on relatively even terms for the title, let alone winning it?</p>","<p>There are, it appears, a lot of good, perhaps even very good, fighters in the women's bantamweight division, but only a handful of great ones. The division has produced a lot of entertaining fights, but no one other than perhaps Nunes has emerged from the pack to stamp herself a legitimate contender.</p>","<p>Rousey helped lift the division to stratospheric heights â she headlined three shows in 2015 and two of them exceeded 1 million pay-per-view sales â by the sheer force of her personality.</p>","<p>She's the sole reason women are fighting in the UFC, yet the division needs to prepare for the day, which probably isn't all that far off, when she's gone for good.</p>","<p>If Holm thrashes Tate in a similar manner to the way she did Rousey, it will leave the cupboard very bare. Yes, styles make fights, but the cold hard truth is that Rousey bested Zingano in 14 seconds a few months after Zingano had stopped Nunes.</p>","<p>There is much at stake Saturday for Holm and Tate. If Tate loses, she'll be 0-3 in her last three championship matches. Even with a depleted field of top contenders, it will be hard for her to get another shot.</p>","<p>If Holm loses, it will render her victory over Rousey a lot less significant.</p>","<p>Tate has clearly worked hard at being relaxed, and at a workout Wednesday, she was jumping up and down during a scrum with reporters, expressing her joy about the match.</p>","<p>But each woman knows there is a long list of expectations they must meet.</p>","<p>It's part of the intrigue to the fight.</p>","<p>As is her wont, the easy-going Holm deflected praise and said it's much easier to do well coming from such a strong team. She's a member of the Albuquerque, N.M.-based Team Jackson/Winkeljohn, where stars like Jon Jones train.</p>","<p>\"When you're as surrounded by greatness as I am,\" Holm asked, \"how can you not feel you're ready to do something great?\"</p>","<p><strong>More UFC 196 coverage from Yahoo Sports:</strong></p>","<p><strong><span class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n   <div style=\"left:0px;\" id=\"ymh-player-swf\" class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\">\n    <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><div class=\"js-video-placeholder RatioBox Bgc-x Bd-0\" data-yepConfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;page_space_id&quot;:&quot;2146234217&quot;,&quot;video_uuid&quot;:&quot;8155291a-83b7-38dc-bb92-383f2d890a32&quot;,&quot;device&quot;:&quot;desktop&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;sports&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{&quot;showTitle&quot;:true,&quot;showDescription&quot;:true,&quot;showButton&quot;:true,&quot;showProvider&quot;:false},&quot;width&quot;:640}\"></div></div>\n   </div></span></strong></p>"]},"property":"sports","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"0a782601-1471-337a-91c4-fabc6ca8d269","licensed":"true","title":"In sign of apocalypse, Donald Trump defends the size of his â¦ hands","link":"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/in-sign-of-apocalypse-donald-trump-defends-the-025053649.html","summary":"During Fox Newsâ Thursday night debate, moderators addressed the somewhat juvenile tone that has overcome the GOP campaign in the past week.","entities":"WIKIID:Donald_Trump|WIKIID:Marco_Rubio","tags_info":{"id":"gop-debates","name":"Gop Debates"},"autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000069|YCT:001000031","tags":["gop-debates","campaign-2016","video","news","politics","donald-trump"],"comments_allowed":"true","is_magazine":"true","author_info":{"name":"Alyssa Bereznak","url":"http://alyssabereznak.tumblr.com/","title":"National Correspondent, Technology","socialInfo":[{"handle":"alyssabereznak","type":"twitter"},{"handle":"alyssabereznak","type":"instagram"},{"handle":"alyssabereznak","type":"tumblr"},{"handle":"alyssab@yahoo-inc.com","type":"email"},{"handle":"+AlyssaBereznak1","type":"googleplus"}],"authorImage":{"width":"215","height":"144","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qJFKf.LQxCKzAAo0goxWUQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w215/134ddeaee814222d260fb58d81bdf820cfe1ac45.png","tag":"original"}},"provider_logo":"","site":"politics","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"1197765159","propertyRegion":"YPROP:politics","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"1197765159","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Donald_Trump;Marco_Rubio;Bret_Baier\" ctopid=\"1035500;1104500\" hashtag=\"gop-debates;campaign-2016;video;news;politics;donald-trump;1035500;1104500\" rs=\"lmsid:a0Vd000000AE7lXEAT;revsp:26cec673-8913-4052-a642-2879edfbc9ca;lpstaid:0a782601-1471-337a-91c4-fabc6ca8d269\"","site":"politics","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"magazine_content_type":"VIDEO","subtype":"video","hosted":true,"publicationDate":"14 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000069","score":"0.745098","label":"Celebrities"},{"term":"YCT:001000031","score":"0.70082","label":"Arts & Entertainment"}],"magazineVideo":{"src":"https://screen.yahoo.com/2016-presidential-campaign-debates/trump-hand-size-024214354.html?format=embed&vp=1","ratio":56.1},"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>Oh, yes he did.Â </p>","<p>During Fox Newsâ Thursday night debate, moderators addressed the somewhat juvenile tone that has overcome the GOP campaign in the past week.</p>","<p>Bret Baier asked Marco Rubio about the contradictory nature of <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/rubio-puts-trump-on-defense-but-still-trails-in-053344856.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">personal attacks</a> he made on Donald Trump recently, including an implication that the businessman peed his pants backstage at the last debate and mocking Trump for having what Rubio described as abnormally short fingers.

Hereâs everything you need to know about the controversial debate that continues to heat up as it makesÂ its way upÂ Capitol Hill. March 3: Support for Apple pours in Apple has added a webpage offering access to amicus briefs from various groups in support of Appleâs stance in the ongoing case. An Amicus curiae means someone who is a friend of the court, and in submitting an amicus brief, the individual or group is throwingÂ support to a certain side. Apple has published amicus briefs from Access Now and the Wickr Foundation, as well as a family member of one of the San Bernardino shootingâs victims, theÂ American Civil Liberties Union, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the protection and promotion of the freedom of opinion and expression, and more. But that was just the tip of the iceberg. More and more companies are adding their names in support of Apple, including Twitter, Reddit, Airbnb, eBay, Github, Kickstarter, LinkedIn, Meetup, Medium, Square, Squarespace, Twilio, Wickr, Automattic, CloudFlare, Atlassian, and Mapbox. âThe governmentâs efforts in this case â to force a private company to affirmatively develop software that does not currently exist in order to break its own security systems â would erode the privacy and protection of user data, and transparency as to how such data may be used or shared,â the aforementioned companies write in their submitted brief. Cyber security experts from universities such as Stanford, UC San Diego, and Harvard also submittedÂ briefs as well, as well as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which paired its brief with 46 other âtechnologists, researchers, and cryptographers.â These people range from the staff software engineer at Google, to the author of the Python programming language, Guido van Rossum. Take a look at the full list of names at the end of the brief, here. Along with the EFF, the Center for Democracy and Technology,Â the Media Institute, as well asÂ AVG Technologies, Data Foundry, Golden Frog, the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), the Internet Association,Â and the Internet Infrastructure CoalitionÂ filed amicus briefs supporting Apple. Intel also addedÂ its support, saying the âorder compelling Apple to provide assistance to the government would have global ramifications far beyond this case.âÂ And AT&T submitted its own brief, citing that Congress should be the ones to act on this case, due to the caseâs far-reaching implications. âUnlike a court, Congress can craft rules that apply equally to all types of information and technology companies,â the telecommunications giant said in its brief. Thirty-two law professors also chimed in with a brief, adding a law-based perspective that âthe underlying order is invalid because it deprives Apple of liberty and property without due process of law.â By filing these briefs, theseÂ groups and individuals are throwing their support behind Apple. David Kaye, the UN rapporteur, submitted a report he presented to the Human Rights Council last June about encryption, which he attached to the amicus brief. Related:Â How much do Americans really value their online privacy? âMy report argued that secure communications are fundamental to the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression in the digital age, permitting the maintenance of opinions without interference and securing the right to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas,â Kaye said in the brief. âEncryption allows for zones of privacy that enable all sorts of expression.â According to The New York Times, more than 40 individuals, ranging from security experts to academics, are expected to submit amicus briefs siding with Apple on March 3. Along with those individuals, major tech leaders including Google, Dropbox, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Snapchat are expected to file briefings in support of the Cupertino company as well. But thereâs resistance as well: the L.A. Times reports that a 41-page amicus brief was filed by relatives of several victims of the San Bernardino shooting, urging the judge to side with the FBI against Apple. But Appleâs legal and commercial rival, Samsung, has decided to throw its lot in with Apple. However, much like other tech leaders, the Korean company only briefly mentionsÂ the importance of encryption and protecting consumerâs privacy. âEnsuring trust in our products and services is our top priority,â a Samsung spokesman told Digital Trends in an emailed statement. âOur phones are embedded with encryption that protects privacy and content, and they do not have backdoors. When required to do so, and within the law, we work with law enforcement agencies. However, any requirement to create a backdoor could undermine consumersâ trust.â The companyâs statements align with Appleâs ethical stance, but Samsung went on to promote its encryption standards in its latest flagship devices, the S7 and the S7 Edge. âSamsung cannot decrypt the userâs encrypted phones,â according to the company. âThe encryption key is randomly generated for each user and the key is protected with the userâs password. Default encryption is turned on for Galaxy S6 and S7.â While it supports encryption, Samsung told Bloomberg Business that it has not yet decided if the company will file an amicus brief in support of Apple. March 1: The debate moves to the House Judiciary Committee AÂ hearing titled âThe Encryption Tightrope: Balancing Americansâ saw FBI Director James Comey testify in front of the committee, along with Appleâs senior vice president and general counsel Bruce Sewell. Sewell was joined withÂ Professor Susan Landau of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. Comey said he wants Apple to remove the guard dog so that the FBI can pick the lock and get into the shooterâs iPhone. Within the first half of the hearing, where the committee questioned Comey, it was sufficiently clear that the FBI would indeed use thisÂ same tactic to other cases if it succeeds in forcing Apple to create a backdoor. Comey saidÂ âpotentially, yes. If the All Writs Act is available to us, and relief under the All Writs Act fits the powers of the statute, of courseâ the bureau would use it to its advantage to gain access to the many other smartphones it has that it cannot break into. Comey repeatedly tried to make it clear that the debate is an important step in finding a solution on how to handle encryption when it comes to criminals and cyberterrorist attacks. He commended Apple on its software and stance, and repeatedly said âthere are no demons in this debate.â But the FBIâs position is clear: It wants Apple to disable the self-destruct/auto-erase feature; disable the feature that spreads out the time between selective guesses; and set up the San Bernardinoâs iPhone so that the FBI can send electronic guesses to crack the passcode every so often. Comey says a judge wouldÂ decide if Apple is allowed to destroy the software that would enable the FBIâs request. Related:Â Boost for Apple as NY judge rules tech firm doesnât have to unlock iPhone for FBI Comey also said the FBI would have quietly broken into the shooterâs iPhone if it could â a fact that some members of the committee had a hard time grasping, considering the bureauâs vast array of resources. âTheyâve set out to make a phone that they canât get into and theyâre darn near succeeding,â Comey responded. âI think with the 6 and beyond, they would have succeeded. That doesnât make them bad people.â Comey also responded to questions surrounding the Justice departmentâs claims that Appleâs stance is simply a marketing ploy, saying that itâs a good reason as Apple is still a business, acting in its best interests. âWeâre doing this because we think protecting the security and privacy of hundreds of millions of iPhone users is the right thing to do,â Sewell said after his testimony began. He went on to state that this debate is not about the San Bernardino case, and there is no real distinction between a 5C or a 6S in this caseÂ â as the tool Apple is being asked to create would be able to hack into any iPhone. And thereâs no doubt that Apple can do what the FBI is asking it to, as Sewell says so himself â the denial stems from the possible consequences. Comey says the courts have to decide if worrying about the consequencesÂ is a reasonable argument to harp on. Appleâs argument is thatÂ the order violates the first and thirteenth amendment, which abolishes slavery. âThis is a compelled speech by the government for the purposes of the government which is absolutely a first amendment problem, and it is speech that Apple does not want to make,â Sewell said. âAnd it is conscription, forced labor.â Itâs still far too early to tell, but the line of questioning seemed to show that more members on the committee seemed to favor Appleâs stance, such as U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren, who said, âitâs a foolâs errand. Weâll never be able to do whatâs being asked of us by the FBI.â But by no means does that mean itâs an easy effort on Appleâs part, as Representative James Sensenbrenner asked Sewell why AppleÂ did not have policy recommendations, unlike the FBI. âYouâve come to us to ask us to do something, but you donât know what you want us to do,â he said. Representative Trey Gowdy offered the same sentiments, asking Sewell to propose what Apple can agree to, and repeatedly asking himÂ to submit legislation recommendations. Sewell said when the courts make a decision, Apple and other tech giants will make recommendations when it is appropriate. âEncryption is a good thing, a necessary thing.,â Sewell said in hisÂ opening remarks. âWeakening encryption will only hurt consumers and other well-meaning users who rely on companies like Apple to protect their personal information.â Feb. 25: Comey appears at House Intelligence Committe hearing FBI director James Comey said heÂ doesnât agree with Tim Cookâs assessment that creating code to unlockÂ Syed Farookâs iPhone would be the âsoftware equivalent of cancer.â âThe code the judge has directed Apple to write works only on this one phone, and so the idea of it getting out in the wild and it working on my phone or your phone â¦ is not a real thing,â Comey said in aÂ House Intelligence Committee hearing focusing on worldwide threats on Feb. 25. Comey bases his argument on the fact that Apple was able to unlock iPhones before 2014 and he doesnât âremember any code getting out that let that ability loose upon the land.â The battle between Apple and the FBI may only be in its infancy, but Comey already recognizes it asÂ âthe hardest question Iâve seen in government.â He believes the FBI has two roles to play regarding the San Bernardino case: conducting an investigation into the terrorist attack and ensuring that peopleÂ understand âthe costs associated with universal strong encryption.â He said he loves encryption, but law enforcementÂ âreally does save peopleâs lives, rescue kids [and] rescue neighborhoods from terrorists â¦ and we do it a whole lot through search warrants of mobile devices.â However, there are âincreasing situations where we cannot with lawful court orders read the communications of terrorists, gang-bangers, pedophiles, all different kinds of bad people. If weâre going to move to a world where that is not possible anymore, the world will not end, but itâll be a different world than where we are today.â While many pundits argue the FBI has the means of unlocking Farookâs iPhone, Comey reiterated thatâs not the case. He said any suggestions of the such areÂ âthe product of people watching too many TV shows.â Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Deputy Director Rick Ledgett testified alongside Comey. Ledgett stressed the importance of retrieving information beyond âmetadataâ such as a userâs location or whom they have called.Â âItâs one thing to know that a person is in a particular place at a particular time,â Ledgett said. âItâs something else entirely â and necessary to understanding and defeating terrorist plots â to know what the target is, what the timing is, how the attack is going to develop.â Feb. 25: Apple files motion to vacate The same day Comey spoke,Â Apple filed a motion to vacate the FBIâs request to force the company to unlock Syed Farookâs iPhone, according to TechCrunch.Â In the motion, Apple contends the FBI is wrongfully using the All Writs Act: âNo court has ever granted the government power to force companies like Apple to weaken its security systems to facilitate the governmentâs access to private individualsâ information. The All Writs Act does not support such sweeping use of judicial power, and the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution forbid it.â Apple argued previously that it would need to write special code in order to unlock Farookâs iPhone, and now it is referring to this new code as GovtOS. Furthermore, the company feels it would also need to create a FBI forensics lab at its headquarters and staff it: âIn order to comply with the Govât demands, Apple would need to create a new âGovtOSâ andÂ FBI forensics lab on site that has the potential to be used on hundreds of phones now in lawÂ enforcements possession in conflict with existing law as well as the First and Fifth AmendmentÂ of the United States Constitution.â The company also believes the FBIâs request is in violation of its constitutional rights: âThe demand violates Appleâs First Amendment rights against compelled speechÂ and viewpoint discrimination. Apple wrote code for its operating system thatÂ reflects Appleâs strong view about consumer security and privacy. By forcingÂ Apple to write software that would undermine those values, the government seeksÂ to compel Appleâs speech and to force Apple to express the governmentâsÂ viewpoint on security and privacy instead of its own.â âThe governmentâs demand also violates Appleâs Fifth Amendment right to be freeÂ from arbitrary deprivation of its liberties in that it would conscript Apple toÂ develop software that undermines the security mechanisms of its own products.â The FBI has contended this case is about one iPhone, but based on the fact that dozens of cases involving other iPhones are pending, Apple argues the government knows itâs not telling the truth: âThe government says: âJust this onceâ and âJust this phone.â But theÂ government knows those statements are not true; indeed the government has filedÂ multiple other applications for similar orders, some of which are pending in other courts.Â And as news of this Courtâs order broke last week, state and local officialsÂ publicly declared their intent to use the proposed operating system to open hundreds ofÂ other seized devicesâin cases having nothing to do with terrorism. If this order isÂ permitted to stand, it will only be a matter of days before some other prosecutor, in some other important case, before some other judge, seeks a similar order using thisÂ case as precedent.â Feb. 24: Tim Cook appears on World News Tonight Tim Cook has been nothing but adamant regarding the potential problems that might stem from the FBIâs request. In a recent interviewÂ on Feb. 24 with ABCâs David Muir, heÂ attempted to drive home whatâs at risk. âThe only way to get information â at least currently, the only way we know â would be to write a piece of software that we view as sort of the equivalent of cancer,â CookÂ told Muir as the two sat in Cookâs Cupertino office. âWe think itâs bad news to write. We would never write it. We have never written it â and that is what is at stake here.â Cook also reiterated Appleâs initial compliance with the government. âWe gave everything that we had [to the FBI],â âWe donât know that thereâs any information on the phone. We donât know whether there is or there isnât, and the FBI doesnât know. What we do know is we passed all of the information that we have on the phone and to get additional information on it or at least what the FBI would like us to do now would expose hundreds of millions of people to issues.â Cook quickly went on to stress the complexity of the issue and how it couldÂ restrict the civil liberties of Appleâs customers. âIf a court can ask us to write this piece of software, think about what else they could ask us to write â maybe itâs an operating system for surveillance, maybe the ability for the law enforcement to turn on the camera,â Cook said. âI donât know where this stops. But I do know that this is not what should be happening in this country.â Feb. 25: iPhone encryption could get even stronger While this case remains undecided, Apple appears to be taking steps towards the future. In an interesting turn of events, the company hired Frederic Jacobs, who was a security engineer of Whisper Systems, developer of the Signal messaging app. I'm delighted to announce that I accepted an offer to be working with the CoreOS security team at Apple this summer. â Frederic Jacobs (@FredericJacobs) February 25, 2016 Jacobs later clarified that it would be an âinternship position,â but declined to discuss the expected duration or his responsibilities. Signal is famous for its end-to-end encryption, of with Jacobs had a major role in. The app is so secure that Edward Snowden admits to using Signal âevery day.â Itâs also one of a handful of messaging apps thatâs highly rated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group. Although nothing has been said publicly, itâs believed that Jacobs will assist Apple in enhancing its encryption measures even further. According to Tim Cook, Apple currently has the ability to backdoor its software, but itâs possible the company is planning to develop a new version in which no one could create a backdoor, not even the creator. If that were to happen, the FBI wouldnât be able to force Apple to unlock iPhones in the future. Feb. 23: Not just one phone The day before Cookâs interview, another new fact in the debate surfaced: The FBI claims it wants Apple to unlock only one iPhone, but the Justice Department is attempting to force Apple to unlock and extract data from about a dozen other iPhones. While the specifics of each case are yet to be made public, they arenât related to terrorism, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street JournalÂ . Prosecutors are supposedly using the same 18th century All Writs Act to compel Apple to unlock the iPhones in question. TheÂ news validated the argument of privacy advocates who claim that the government wants to break encryption in many cases, not just this one terrorist threat.Â On the other hand, many government leaders could use this information to show why encryption of personal devices must be stopped. According to sources, the iPhones from these other cases are even older than Farookâs iPhone 5C, so the security standards arenât as stringent. Another unrelated case givesÂ further credence to the fears of privacy advocates. Federal prosecutors in New York are battling Apple over an iPhone that was seized during a drug investigation. A letter filed with U.S. MagistrateÂ Judge James Orenstein on Feb. 22 implies the existence of around a dozen other cases without getting into specifics. âIn most of the cases, rather than challenge the orders in court, Apple simply deferred complying with them, without seeking appropriate judicial relief,ââ the prosecutors wrote. In another filing related to the same case, Apple listed twelve other cases since October 18, 2015, in which the FBI has compelled the company to unlock eleven iPhones and one iPad. Apple objected to ten of them and is awaiting further information on the remaining two. The table below was obtained by Mashable. The judge is now asking whether it was legal for the government to force Apple to pull data from a locked phone, which could be an indication that he is leaning towards the privacy side of the fence. To fully understand Appleâs ongoing battle with the United States government, itâs necessary to rewind to the beginning of the story. Feb. 16: The battle begins On Tuesday, Feb. 16, U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym for the Central District of California ordered Apple to disable the iPhoneâs auto-erase function, a feature that deletes a smartphoneâs data after 10 failed passcode attempts. This would help the FBI gain access into San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farookâs phone to see who he and his wife were in contact with, and to confirm any ties to ISIS. The news exploded across mainstream media outlets, stirring up over a million tweets and ultimately drawing a response from CEO Tim Cook. Related:Â Tim Cook denounces âchillingâ FBI demands Apple doesnât have the means to disable the auto-erase function, which introduced tougher security measures in iOS 8 following the NSA-leak by Snowden, and Cook immediately responded to the judgeâs order on Feb. 17 Â via a letter to Apple customersÂ denying the court order and urging consumers to take a stand for encryption and privacy. While Apple cannot disable the function, Cook says the U.S. government asking Apple to create a backdoor to the iPhone is something the company considers âtoo dangerous.â âThe FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation,â Cook said in the letter. âIn the wrong hands, this software â which does not exist today â would have the potential to unlockÂ anyÂ iPhone in someoneâs physical possession.â Court records state that Apple needs to write to code to createÂ a Software Image File the FBI can use on subjectÂ devices itÂ requires access to. The worry is that this new method would be duplicated in some way, or get into the wrong hands, risking user privacy.Â âThe SIF will be coded by Apple with a unique identifier of the phone, so that the SIF would only load and execute on the subject device,â the court order states. It appears the reason for this battle is the fact that the Apple ID password on the iPhone in question was changed less than 24 hours after the government took possession of it. A senior Apple executive told reporters during a conference call on Friday, Feb 19 that if that hadnât happened, the company wouldnât need to create a backdoor into the device, as the information would have been easily accessible via iCloud. According to the unnamed executive, Apple was in discussions with the FBI since early January and proposed four different ways to recover the information. Apple even sent engineers to try these methods. One method involved connecting the iPhone to a known Wi-Fi network while plugged in. This could be atÂ Farookâs home or office. The idea is that it would trigger an automatic backup to iCloud, which Apple would gladly turn over to the FBI. When this failed, Apple investigated the situation further and found out the ID password was changed online by someone from theÂ county health department. Unfortunately there is no way to enter the new password on the locked iPhone, which would allow it to be backed up to iCloud. The FBI was able to recover some of the deviceâs data since Farookâs iPhone was backed up to iCloud six weeks prior to the attack. While Apple did turn over that data to authorities, the FBI still needs the data between the last backup and the attack. Unfortunately Farook didnât initiate a backup during those six weeks, and itâs unclear whether the phone was set to auto-backup or not. Itâs uncertain why the password changed, but itâs clear Apple is now placing blame on the FBI. However is it the FBI or the county health department thatâs at fault? The SanÂ Bernardino Countyâs official Twitter account chimed in withÂ âThe County was working cooperatively with the FBI when it reset the iCloud password at the FBIâs request.â The County was working cooperatively with the FBI when it reset the iCloud password at the FBI's request. â CountyWire (@CountyWire) February 20, 2016 The next day, the FBI confirmed this to be true by stating, âThe FBI worked with San Bernardino County to reset the iCloud password on December 6th, as the county owned the account and was able to reset the password in order to provide immediate access to the iCloud backup data.â However, the FBI doesnât believe this has any affect on the fact that it wants the data on the phone, stating the resetÂ â[does] not impact Appleâs ability to assist with the the court order under the All Writs Act,â and adding that âthe governmentâs objective was, and still is, to extract as much evidence as possible from the phone.â Apple isnât buying this argument as a senior engineer reiterated that changing the password prevented the auto backup and closed the door on being able to obtain the information. The court order was made through the use of a 227-year-old law â the All Writs Act of 1789, which lets federal courts issue court orders that force third-parties to cooperate and be helpful to other court orders. Appleâs argument is that what the FBI is offering is âburdensome,â as it would tarnish its reputation and would cause its customers to lose trust in the company. Feb. 19: The DOJ weighs in Days after Apple refused to create a âbackdoorâ for the FBI to access encrypted data in an iPhone used by the shooter in Decemberâs San Bernardino attacks,Â the U.S. Department of Justice joined the FBI against one the countryâs biggest tech companies.Â On February 19, the Justice DepartmentÂ filed a motion with aÂ federal district court seeking to compel Apple to cooperate with the FBI in decryptingÂ Syed Rizwan Farookâs iPhone. Apple originally had five business days to officially respond to theÂ FBIâsÂ court order, but in light of the DOJâs recent request, it now has until February 26. U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker, who wrote in Fridayâs motion that âthe order does not, as Appleâs public statement alleges, require Apple to create a âbackdoorâ to every iPhone, it does not provide âhackers and criminalsâ access to iPhones, it does not require Apple to âhack [its] own usersâ or to âdecrypt its own phonesâ; it does not give the government âthe power to reach into anyoneâs deviceâ without a warrant or court authorization, and it does not compromise the security of personal information.â FBI Director James Comey reiterated Deckerâs points Sunday in an op-ed in LawfareÂ titled, âWe Could Not Look the Survivors in the Eye if We Did Not Follow this Lead.â âWe simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terroristâs passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly.Â Thatâs it,â noted Comey. He went on to say candidly that the FBI is not interested in back doors, breaking encryption, or anything outside trying to guess Farookâs password. He also pointedly remarked that as the tension continues to grow between the dialogue over privacy and safety, âthat tension should not be resolved by corporations that sell stuffÂ for a living.â On Monday, Feb. 22, Apple CEO Tim Cook made plain his displeasure with the government in a public email to employees requesting âthe government to withdraw its demands.âÂ In the email titled, âThank you for your supportâ Cook noted that he sincerely believes the best solution is a proactive one, and that the U.S. government should create a commission to further discuss and reckon with the issue between law enforcementâs access to technology and American civil liberties: âOur country has always been strongest when we come together. We feel the best way forward would be for the government to withdraw its demands under the All Writs Act and, as some in Congress have proposed, form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms. Apple would gladly participate in such an effort.â Apple also launched a new webpage explaining its current feelings about the entire issue, including an FAQ. In that FAQ, Apple clarifies that it will not willingly create anything for the FBI akin to a âmaster keyâ that can be used to access any iPhone, even if itâs only used on a single device, as it will likely never remain safe. âThe only way to guarantee that such a powerful tool isnât abused and doesnât fall into the wrong hands is to never createÂ it.â Appleâs FAQ site also goes on to express that âweâve handed over all the data we have, including a backup of the iPhone in question. But now they have asked us for information we simply do notÂ have.â This is just the beginning. The FBI and Justice Department continue to press Apple to enable the FBI direct access of some kind to Farookâs iPhone. Feb. 18: Biometrics? The technology of encryption In this case, the FBI has to rely on cracking the phoneâs encryption, because Farookâs iPhone 5C doesnât have a fingerprint scanner. If the device were an iPhone 5S, 6/6Plus, or 6S/6S Plus, however, the FBI may have considered using the dead suspectâs fingerprint to unlock the device, legal experts told Forbes. âFingerprint evidence â- unlike a password â- is physical evidence that can be compelled with a court order, overriding the objections of an accused or the next of kin of an accused,â Andrea Matwyshyn, Northeastern University professor of law and a visiting research collaborator at the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University told Forbes. Matwyshyn added that since fingerprint data is often available to the government through various databases, it wouldnât be hard to find and forensic examiners may even be able to lift fingerprints from the phone itself to unlock the device. Marina Medvin, owner of Medvin Law, told Forbes that although forcing a living suspect to give up their fingerprint may violate 4th Amendment privacy protections, the amendment doesnât apply to the dead. What of encryption itself? Understanding how it works in detail requires mathematical knowledge that most people simply donât have; we wonâtÂ try to cover every step (but read more juicy info here). To put it as simply as possible, the original data goesÂ through an âexclusive orâ function alongside the value of the encryption key. TheÂ function registers false if the inputs are the same, and trueÂ if they are not. If youâre familiar with computers, youâll immediately recognize that this false/true function is binary, and so it generates a new set of binary data from the input of the original data and the key. Then, to make it even harder to crack, AES encryption (Advanced Encryption Standard, the sort on the iPhone) uses a number of additional steps to further secure data. Decryption reverses them to find the original message â but onlyÂ if the key is known, since it was used to complete the encryption functions. Youâve probably at some point heard that encryption keys come in different types, like 64-bit, 128-bit, and 256-bit. The more bits in the key, the harder it becomes to decrypt, because the original data is more thoroughly muddled through the âexclusive orâ andÂ successive steps. And when I say difficult, I mean difficult.Â The iPhone in question in this case is protected by 256-bit AES encryption. No computer currently in existence canÂ break 256-bit AES through brute-force even if it started working on the problem at the beginning of the universe. In fact, it would take hundreds of billions of years for a modern supercomputer to crack 256-bit AES just by guessing. Feb. 22: San Bernardino victims want Apple to comply, but one Mom sides with privacy Families who lost loved ones in San Bernardino are finally speaking out regarding the battle of encryption between Apple and the FBI.Â ReutersÂ has learned that some of the victims will file a legal brief by early March in support of the FBIâs effort to force Apple to unlock Farookâs iPhone. The groupâs attorney, Stephen Larson, said the victimsÂ âwere targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen.â Itâs very possible this support could prove to be a strong ally for the federal government, who is likely to push this fight to the Supreme Court if it has to. Larson, who used to be aÂ federal judge, is representing the case for free. However, not all victims of the San Bernardino terrorist attack are in support of the FBI.Â Carole Adams, who tragically lost her son, Robert Adams, at the hands of Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife is in full support of Apple. âThis is what separates us from communism, isnât it? The fact we have the right to privacy,â Adams said in an interview with the New York Post on Feb 18. âI think Apple is definitely within their rights to protect the privacy of all Americans.â She continued,Â âThis is what makes America great to begin with, that we abide by a constitution that gives us the right of privacy, the right to bear arms, and the right to vote.â Adams made it clear that getting into Farookâs iPhone is important, but she thinks it needs to be done without putting others at risk. Feb. 17: Tech titans weigh in The case has been dubbed as the most important in a decade by Edward Snowden, who also questioned Googleâs silence on the issue. This is the most important tech case in a decade. Silence means @google picked a side, but it's not the public's. https://t.co/mi5irJcr25 â Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 17, 2016 But Googleâs CEO, Sundar Pichai, came through â in defense of Apple. Pichai cited the importance of Cookâs letter in a tweet, and said that âforcing companies to enable hacking could compromise usersâ privacy.â 3/5 We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders â sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) February 17, 2016 4/5 But thatâs wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent â sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) February 17, 2016 Pichaiâs statementâs arenât as forcefulÂ as Cookâs, but theyâre hardly unsurprising, as Google has been at the forefront of the privacy and encryption conversation,Â along with Apple and various other leading tech companies. Related:Â Developer pulls Twitter trading app from App Store over privacy fears Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told CNBC he agrees with Appleâs position, but more importantly, he felt former Apple CEO Steve Jobs would have done the same.Â âI think Steve would have gone for the privacy,â Wozniak said during a phone call to CNBCâs Power Lunch. When asked if Apple should be more willing to comply with the FBI because the San Bernardino case involved terrorism, Wozniak seemed to say that he didnât believe it was terrorism and that itâs a phony word being used for a shooting crime. When hostÂ Tyler Mathisen pointed out that the killers were connected to terror groups, Wozniak said âYou canât generalize that and say thatâs the only way embarrassing information would ever be used. Ask anybody on Facebook.â In other words, the FBI could say this is why it wants the info today and come up with a different reason tomorrow. Wozniak noted one time the FBI visited Apple to talk about the possibility of spies getting into the companyâs information network. Jobs asked the FBI if it did the same thing, and the answer was no. Wozniak believed the FBI was lying that day and further implied that you canât trust an organization that isnât truthful. Wozniak did say that he felt Apple could create a backdoor without handing it over to the FBI, but he warns that Apple as we know it today might not be the same company tomorrow. Insiders could decide to leak the backdoor at a later date. With all of this said, Wozniakâs hunch is that Apple will eventually be forced to comply with the FBI after a vigilant fight. If that does happen, and a backdoor is created, Wozniak claims he will continue to use his iPhone â heâs fighting for everyone else, not himself. In a strange and unexpected effort to stay relevant, John McAfee, who is still running for president, has called it a âblack dayâ and the beginning of the end of the U.S. as a world power. To prevent Apple from giving the FBI a tool to hack into the iPhone, McAfeeÂ has offered himself and his team to hack into the San Bernardino terroristâs smartphone. âSo here is my offer to the FBI,â McAfee said in an editorial on the International Business Times. âI will, for free, decrypt the information on the San BernardinoÂ phone, with my team. We will primarily use social engineering and it will take us three weeks. IfÂ you accept my offer, then you will not need to ask Apple to place a backdoor in their product,Â which will be the beginning of the end of America.â Related:Â John McAfee: As the dark Web bubbles up to the mainstream, hacking just got easier Numerous organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Tor Project, Mozilla, DuckDuckGo, and more have come out in support of Apple. And a few of the big players have stayedÂ mum on the issue, or are at least slow to weigh in. Reform Government Survelliance (RGS) has issued a statement throwing its support, unsurprisingly, with Apple. The group has sent letters to the Senate and to The White House before, defending the use of encryption. Itâs a coalition of leading tech companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Yahoo, Twitter, AOL, and Dropbox. âReform Government Surveillance companies believe it is extremely important to deter terrorists and criminals and to help law enforcement by processing legal orders for information in order to keep us all safe,â according to theÂ statement. âBut technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their usersâ information secure. RGS companies remain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customersâ information.â While many tech giants side with Apple, Microsoftâs co-founder isnât coming along for the ride. Bill Gates told the Financial Times on Feb 22 that granting the FBI access to Farookâs iPhone wouldnât set a meaningful legal precedent because the FBI is ânot asking for some general thing, [it is] asking for a particular case.â He went on to say,Â âIt is no different than [the question of] should anybody ever have been able to tell the phone company to get information, should anybody be able to get at bank records. Letâs say the bank had tied a ribbon round the disk drive and said âdonât make me cut this ribbon, because youâll make me cut it many times.ââ Gates further clarified his comments in a Feb 23 appearance on Bloomberg TV. âI do believe that with the right safeguards, there are cases where the government, on our behalf â like stopping terrorism, which could get worse in the future â that that is valuable. But striking that balance â clearly the government [has] taken information, historically, and used it in ways that we didnât expect, going all the way back, say, to the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover. So Iâm hoping now we can have the discussion. I do believe there are sets of safeguards where the government shouldnât have to be completely blind.â After a long silence, Microsoft finally came to Appleâs side on Feb. 25.Â âWe at Microsoft support Apple and will be filing an amicus brief next week,â Microsoft president Brad Smith said at aÂ Congressional hearing on the laws governing data transfers across borders. An amicus is literally a friend of the court. Itâs someone (or a business) who is not a party to a case, but can offer information that could be of importance to the case. More importantly, the amicus isnât solicited by any of the parties to assist the court. Smith used an adding machine from 1911 to demonstrate his argument. He said, âWe do not believe that courts should seek to resolve issues of 21st Century technology with a law that was written in the era of the adding machine,â referring to the 18th centuryÂ All Writs Act. BloombergÂ is now reported that Googleâs parent Alphabet, Facebook, and Twitter will also file separate amicus briefings in support of Apple. Feb. 17: Here come the politicians According to Reuters, White House spokesman Josh Earnest says that the government is not asking Apple to create a new backdoor, but is simply referring to one device in one case. He told a pool of reporters that âthe president certainly believes this is an important national priority.â Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump hasnât wasted time in offering his sentiments on the controversial issue. During an interview on the Fox News program Fox and Friends, Trump backed the courts and said that âwe should be able to get into the phoneâ to find out why it happened and if others wereÂ involved in the December shooting. âTo think that Apple wonât allow us to get into [the shooterâs] cell phone?â Trump said. âWho do they think they are? No, we have to open it up.â Trump also called people to boycott Apple while campaigning in South Carolina, until the Cupertino company cooperates with the FBI. He then tweeted about the boycott via an Android device, according to his post on TweetDeck. The sentiment isÂ shared by the shooting victimsâ families and friends. CBS Local reports the family of victim Yvette Velasco criticized the Cupertino company, and finds it âdifficult to understand why Apple would not jump at the opportunity to help uncover whatever information the phone may contain.â Related:Â Apple CEO Tim Cook pushes back against FBI, court order to hack iPhone But thereâs a great deal of support on the other side as well. AppleInsider is reporting that advocacy group Fight for the Future held a rally outside San Franciscoâs Apple Store on Wednesday, drumming up support for Appleâs defense for privacy. The organization will stageÂ nationwide protests outside Apple stores in more than 30 cities on Tuesday, Feb. 23 at 5:30pm local time. These include Boston,Â New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, Â and Palo Alto in the U.S., as well as Hong Kong and Munich internationally. A rally is also planned for FBIâs headquarters in Washington, DC on the same day. Click here, for a detailed map of all the cities. You can even host your own rally if your city isnât included. You can find the guidelines here. Popular conservative commentator, Glenn Beck, also supports Apple. âThis is insanity. Tim Cook is right,â Beck said inÂ a Facebook post. âApple is on the right side of history on this issue.â Itâs a strong endorsement, considering that Beck said he isnât a fan of the company, only its product. Beck, a proponent forÂ smaller government, also said, âThe government CANNOT bully private companies.â In closing, he said, âI stand with Apple and I encourage you to do the same. Do your own homework and spread the word.â Thereâs no mention of Apple or the San Bernardino case, Â but the statement has been retweeted by Microsoftâs Chief Legal Officer, Brad Smith, and in turn was retweeted by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. While that so far has been the extent of Microsoftâs acknowledgment surrounding the issue, other tech companies like Amazon have not commented at all. Facebook and Twitter havenât outright said anything, not includingÂ what the RGS said in its statement. Jan Koum, CEOÂ of Whatsapp which is owned by Facebook, backed Apple and saidÂ in a Facebook post, âWe must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set. Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake.â Feb. 20: Apple Attorney, President Obama weigh in The Obama administration also chimed in and told the U.S. magistrate judge, who issued the court order, that it is willing to let Apple keep possession and destroy the software created to hack into the San Bernardino shooterâs phone, according to the Associated Press. âApple may maintain custody of the software, destroy it after its purpose under the order has been served, refuse to disseminate it outside of Apple and make clear to the world that it does not apply to other devices or users without lawful court orders,â the Justice Department told Judge Sheri Pym, according to the Associated Press. âNo one outside Apple would have access to the software required by the order unless Apple itself chose to share it.â Furthermore, prosecutors arenât buying Tim Cookâs argument that Apple is protecting the privacy of all its customers. The filing argues that Apple seems more concerned for its âbusiness model and public brand marketing strategy.âÂ Decker also noted that the original order allows Apple to retain custody of the software that would be developed to decrypt the iPhone. The company even has a right to determine how it helps the government in its investigation. According to Tom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Central District of California, a federal court hearing is scheduled for March 22 in California.Â The Justice Departmentâs motion to compel did not offer any penalties if Apple doesnât comply, according to Reuters. The Justice Department also declined to comment on what recourse its seeking if any. Interestingly enough, the prosecutorsÂ acknowledged that the filing âis not legally necessary.â Complying with the FBIâs request couldÂ âdestroy the iPhone as it exists,â said Ted Olson, Appleâs lead attorney, during an appearance on ABCâs âThis Weekâ on February 21. He then doubled down on Tim Cookâs previous comments thatÂ a backdoor opens security holes, which would affect every iPhone and could spur abuse from foreign governments. Olson reiterated the companyâs assistance in the past, and that Apple and Tim Cook have the âthe greatest respectâ for the FBI. However, the companyÂ âhas to draw the line at recreating code, changing its iPhone, putting its engineers and creative talents to destroy the iPhone as it exists. Apple has a responsibility to maintain the trust and faith of millions of people who have depended upon Apple to produce a product that protects their privacy, their intimate personal life. This is a Pandoraâs Box.â Updates: Updated on 03-03-2016 by Julian Chokkattu:Â Added the various groups and companies that have thrown its support for Apple via amicus briefs, including Intel, AVG Technologies, BSA, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Media Institute, Twitter, Reddit, the EFF, AT&T, and more.Â  Updated on 03-03-2016 by Julian Chokkattu:Â  Added information from Appleâs webpage offering a look at amicus briefs received from various groups supporting Appleâs position.
