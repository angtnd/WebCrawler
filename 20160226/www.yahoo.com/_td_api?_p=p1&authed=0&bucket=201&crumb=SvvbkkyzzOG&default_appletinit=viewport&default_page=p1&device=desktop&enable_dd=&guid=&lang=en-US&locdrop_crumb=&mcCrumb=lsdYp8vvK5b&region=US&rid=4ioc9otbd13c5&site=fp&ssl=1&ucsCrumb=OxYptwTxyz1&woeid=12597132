The Swiss â who was most recently the general secretary of Europe's governing body, UEFA â becomes just the third head of soccer's global governing body since 1974, although reforms now mostly reduce the new president to a figurehead.</p>","<p><strong>[ FC Yahoo: <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-fc-yahoo/fifa-presidential-election-live-stream-054506352.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">See how the FIFA presidential election unfolded</a> ]</strong></p>","<p>Infantino won the first round of voting over Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain by 88 votes to 85 â while Prince Ali Bin Hussein of Jordan garnered 27 votes and Frenchman Jerome Champagne got seven â but didn't secure the two-thirds majority needed to avoid a do-over. In the second round â the first in a FIFA presidential election since 1974, when Joao Havelange ousted Stanley Rous â a majority of 50 percent plus one vote was enough to prevail, and Infantino won with 115 votes.</p>","<p>Sheikh Salman, the marginal favorite going into this Extraordinary FIFA Congress staged to replace the ousted and disgraced Sepp Blatter, managed just 88 votes.</p>","<p>Once each of the five candidates had given a speech ahead of the vote, U.S. Soccer president and FIFA Executive Committee member Sunil Gulati â who lectures on economics at Columbia University by day â was seen scurrying around the room between candidates and power brokers. While voting is secret and none of the conversations were audible, it is widely assumed that the United States played a big role in swaying the election in Infantino's favor.</p>","<p>Gulati, after all, had indicated that the Americans would vote for Prince Ali, the reformist candidate via Twitter on Thursday. Ali's votes were in play for the second round when it became clear the underdog had no chance of winning, and Gulati likely held considerable sway over where they would go. It's worth noting here that the USA will likely bid to host the 2026 World Cup, after it missed out on the 2022 edition under dubious circumstances.</p>","<span class=\"yui-tweet yui-editorial-embed\">\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n  <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ussoccer\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">@ussoccer</a> will vote for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AliForFIFA\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">@AliForFIFA</a> for President of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIFA?src=hash\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">#FIFA</a></p>â Sunil Gulati (@sunilgulati) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sunilgulati/status/702973740653649920\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">February 25, 2016</a>\n </blockquote></span>","<p>By that point, Tokyo Sexwale had dropped out at the end of the only entertaining speech after four very bland ones â although Infantino speaking in six languages was impressive. It was all a dog and pony show, of course. There were hardly any undecided voters left out of the 207 delegates representing one nation or territory each. (Kuwait and Indonesia, the other two countries making up FIFA's 209 members, were suspended over government interference into national soccer affairs.) And whoever still needed convincing wasn't going to make do with mere words on FIFA's cut-throat horse-trading floor.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Infantino was widely seen as a more suitable candidate than co-favorite Sheikh Salman, who <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-fc-yahoo/fifa-presidential-election-will-come-down-to-two-candidates-110725697.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">faces questions over human rights abuses in his native country</a>. The 45-year-old Infantino has a clean record, although he is somewhat tainted by association as the right-hand man of Michel Platini.</p>","<p>The currently suspended UEFA president was ensnared in the scandal over the $2 million \"disloyal payment\" from Blatter in 2011 â widely assumed to have been a bribe for Platini to stay out of that year's FIFA presidential election. Both men claim it was a fee for consultancy work done for Blatter by Platini in 2002. Yet neither man has been able to convincingly explain the time gap in time and both were suspended for eight years, later reduced to six, although they maintain their innocence.</p>","<p>But a package of sweeping reforms passed with 89 percent of the vote earlier on Friday renders the office of FIFA president much less powerful than it had been under Blatter or his predecessor and mentor Havelange. Those men wielded immense power and set the tone, direction and agenda for an entire sport by themselves.</p>","<p>Now, however, the president will be stripped of some of his functions and the once-mighty Executive Committee shall be diluted and renamed the FIFA Council.</p>","<p>Infantino campaigned on a promise of more money for the member countries â a classic Blatter play. But he will no longer have executive powers, unlike his predecessors, and won't get a tie-breaking vote on the Council as Blatter had on the Executive Committee. And he will be limited to three four-year terms, after Havelange clung to power for 24 years and Blatter for 17. Infantino's first term completes Blatter's, which began in late May 2015, three days before he announced his resignation following a series of Swiss and FBI raids and Department of Justice indictments of his allies. The president's compensation, meanwhile, will be disclosed for the first time.</p>","<p>The Executive Committee will be replaced by the Council and increase from 24 members to 36 â mandating a minimum of six women, rather than one. The Council will no longer get to vote on World Cup hosts, a duty that will fall to the Congress, made up of all 209 member nations. Standing committees will be cut from 26 to nine and several layers of oversight and compliance mechanisms will be inserted into the structure.</p>","<p>Crucially, the Council, unlike the Executive Committee, will no longer oversee business decisions â which, along with the World Cup allocation, were the primary source of collusion and graft. That will be handled by the new Secretary General and his administration, to be appointed and overseen by the Council.</p>","<p>Which is all to say that the real power within FIFA's corridors has been decentralized, fragmented and dispersed to a much larger group of people. It surely won't stamp out corruption entirely, but it will go some way towards cleaning up FIFA's famously dirty dealings.</p>","<p>The new president, then, isn't a like-for-like replacement of the old one.</p>","<p>And in FIFA's case, that's rather a good thing.</p>","<p><em>Leander Schaerlaeckens is a soccer columnist for Yahoo Sports.

But we also know health isnât wholly visible from the outside. A person with a thin waist may be extremely unhealthy for various reasons (say, if theyâre a heavy smoker), while someone with thicker thighs or curvy hips may have great cholesterol, eat well and exercise often. (Thatâs why BMI is a questionable way to assess healthiness, as French lawmakers recently found out with their <a href=\"http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/04/20/is-frances-proposed-law-to-ban-ultra-thin-models-really-a-good-idea/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">controversial measure</a> to regulate the modeling industry by BMI.)</p> \n <p class=\"\">Those who follow Graham on Instagram know that the 28-year-old is committed to health as an avid exerciser.

The body positivityÂ movement, which has helped drive the rise of so-called \"plus-size modelsâ in fashion, isnât so much about promoting any lifestyle but rather representation.

It's a really cool period of time for me. My work that I do for the UN is all very clearly outlined, but my personal views and opinions are still being defined, really.â <br><br>Yesterday, Watson interviewed feminist icon and activist legend Gloria Steinem in front of a sold-out crowd at Emmanuel Centre in London to discuss Steinem's new book <em>My</em> <em>Life on the Road â</em> her first in 20 years. So what did they discuss? What would these two figureheads of modern feminism debate? What do they care about? What did Gloria have to say about \"After Black Power, Women's Liberation\"? <br><br>Sadly, a google search won't shed any light on the topics of conversation. The talk was 'covered', but several mainstream media outlets preferred to talk about Watson's newly dyed \"ombre hair\" and her \"strong brows.\" <em>The Daily Mail </em>(naturally the top search) ran with the headline: '\"I used to hate my strong eyebrows\": Emma Watson talks embracing insecurities and accepting that she is \"rather like Hermione\" during interview with Gloria Steinem.' The second article google retrieves is titled: '<a href=\"http://www.teenvogue.com/story/emma-watson-ombre-hair\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Emma Watson Hairstyles - Emma Watson New Hair Color</a>.' <em><a href=\"http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/emma-watson-interviewed-feminist-legend-gloria-steinem-but-all-the-media-wanted-to-talk-about-was-her-eyebrows--Zyx6_ktcKCe\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">The Independent</a></em> did a round up of all the articles that chose to lead with comments on Watson's physical appearance over the contents of her discussion. <br><br>Beyond holding tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with brilliant brains, Watson is starring in the live-action adaptation of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> and working tirelessly as the <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/09/emma-watson-un-speech-feminism\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">UN Women Goodwill Ambassador</a>.

What more does this woman have to do to be taken seriously? What have her highlights got to do with anything she was attempting to achieve yesterday? <br><br>It seems another characteristically brazen curtailing of an opinionated female voice by the British press in the favour of articles that largely centre on what said woman is wearing, not wearing, eating, and not eating. <br><br>Hollywood actresses have begun to push back on journalists who choose to focus on their physicality over their work in small but marked ways.

Not to mention that the role of the American father is changing. According to the Pew Research Center, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/18/5-facts-about-todays-fathers/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">roughly 7% of U.S. fathers stay at home</a>Â â thatâs roughly 2 million men who care for their children at home, which is actually pretty cool.</p> <p>Fatherhood comes with surprises that will add new color and meaning to your life.Â Becoming a parent isÂ a huge life adjustment, and it brings with it some changes you might not be expecting. Here are some surprising things that happen when you becomeÂ a dad.</p> 1. You may be confused <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.parents.com/baby/new-parent/fatherhood/surprises/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Parents.com</a>, confusion is somethingÂ you may experience in the first few months of fatherhood. On one end of the spectrum, thereâs virility, power, and pride with having created a new life; on the other, there are feelings of helplessness when you canât satisfy or even understand your babyâs needs.</p> 2. Youâll discoverÂ a different kind of love <p>It may not be the same type of love you have for your significant other, and thatâs OK. It may be even more powerful. There is no comparing the all-consuming love that youâll have for your child.</p> 3. You may feel ambivalence <p>Ah, the confusion of fatherhood.Â Itâs not a bad thing, though â in fact, itâs completely normal. One day youâll look at your child and realize the intense passion you felt the day before has been replaced by a numb feeling. Can you do this? Do you care? Do you really want to take on the responsibilities that come with fatherhood? After considering these questions, youâll experience guilt for not being head-over-heels in love 100% of the time. You might thinkÂ this meansÂ youâre not a good father, but you are so wrong. Ambivalence is normal and is something you will experience for the rest of your life with your child.</p> 4. You may experience depression <p>Postpartum depression may be specific to women, but plenty of guys alsoÂ experience depressionÂ after their babies are born. Although your blues are not hormonal like they are with postpartum, your depression may be caused by the realization of having to return back to reality after the baby is born. All the excitement of the baby coming was built up, but after a few weeks, itâs back to the daily grind at work and all the trivialities that come along with daily life. Add to that sleep interruption, and more to do around the house â thatâs enough to depress anyone.</p> 5. Youâll be afraid <p>Again, this is completely natural and expected. The first few months of fatherhood are littered with fears that you wonât live up to your expectations, that you wonât be a good father, etc. Your fears will go away once you start to get the hang of fatherhood. The unknown is always scary.</p> 6. Your relationship with yourÂ significant other will change <p>Before you and your S.O. became parents you both were able to spend a lot of time together, nurturing each other and making your relationship stronger. Once the baby comes, everything changes and your alone time becomes almostÂ non-existent. Your newborn is the focus of everything you do. You will both barely have time to sleep let alone spend time together.</p> <p>This means that both of you will have to put the effort in to carve out alone time and discuss other things besides the baby. ItÂ is very important that you donâtÂ let your relationship suffer â make it a priority. It will only benefit your child in the long run if his or her parents have a healthy relationship.</p> More from Health & Fitness Cheat Sheet: \n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/how-to-be-a-happy-dad-and-why-its-important.html/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">How to Be a Happy Dad (And Why Itâs Important)</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/4-bad-habits-dads-to-be-should-break.html/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">4 Bad Habits Dads-to-Be Should Break</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/3-things-you-can-do-to-keep-your-kids-healthy.html/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">3 Things You Can Do to Keep Your Kids Healthy</a></li> \n </ul> <p><em>Want more great content like this?Â <a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/members/index.php?r=register&ref=CTA\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Sign up here</a>Â to receive the best of Cheat Sheet delivered daily.

She got that kind of cash from <em>Full House </em>residuals, thanks to all those reruns. In 2007, she gave a speech about sobriety, while she was high on meth and cocaine. But now she has turned her life around, and sees <em>Fuller House</em> as a chance to go home again. </p>","<p>The actress says that through it all, she relied on her <em>Full House </em>castmates as close friends. \"When people are like, 'Oh you guys kept in touch' I am like no, we practically live at each other's houses,\" she said. \"I grew up as an only child so Candace [Cameron] and Andrea [Barber] were like the closest thing that I had to real sisters.\"</p>","<p>Another thing we learn in the interview is what Stephanie is up to now. Even though her sister has the better name for it, Stephanie is, get this, a D.J. who travels the world and plays at Coachella. And aside from updated pop-culture references, it seems like<em> Fuller House</em> will have the exact look and feel of the '90s sitcom. \"The show gives people the thing they have been missing,\" Sweetin says. \"The thing that makes them feel all warm and fuzzy inside.\" </p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"style","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"778e2234-b889-3527-86e9-c7c617632428","licensed":"true","title":"Are the 49ers done with Colin Kaepernick or is he done with them?","link":"http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2016/2/26/11119246/49ers-done-colin-kaepernick-trade-rumors-2016-nfl-draft","summary":"Kaepernick wants to be traded.

Fares usually go up dramatically within 14 days of the flight.\"</p>","<p>To help you game airline prices, you can think of the best periods to purchase tickets as specific blocks of time. Most airlines start selling tickets around 335 days before a flight, Klee said, but anyone buying a ticket almost a year in advance will probably shell out around $50 more than they would during the âPrime Booking Window.â</p>","<p>From 113 to 196 days out, travelers will have more flight route options to choose from, and tickets are just $20 more than the âPrime Booking Window.â Bargain hunters will want to wait for the prime discount window for the best deal, and fares will tend to fluctuate day by day during this period.</p>","<p>However, once youâre around two weeks away from your flight, travelers pay an average of $75 over the cheapest fares, and from one to six days in advance, that premium shoots up to $200.</p>","<p>\"54 days is a good number to start with, but it's important to know that every trip is different,\" Klee said.</p>","<p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/25/best-time-cheap-plane-tickets/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">See original article on Fortune.com</a></p>","<p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/25/best-time-cheap-plane-tickets/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> <strong>More from Fortune.com</strong> </a></p>","<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/06/oct-6-holiday-travel-flights/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Why October 6 is the best day to book Thanksgiving travel</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/02/when-to-book-flights-fall/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Here's when to travel to get the best fall flight deals</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/02/labor-day-travel-gas-prices/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Here's why you should stay home this Labor Day weekend</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/07/27/airfares-will-drop-to-record-lows-this-fall/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Airfares will drop to record lows this fall</a></li> \n</ul>","<br>","<span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dRbe7rxIQRsNRARAofaSLw--/aD0xO3c9MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fortune_175/368777f6530225bb40436bbd54179793\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"false","id":"da80d350-2233-3b55-9b5f-670f1888b918","categoryLabel":"Entertainment","cluster_id":"da80d350-2233-3b55-9b5f-670f1888b918","licensed":"false","title":"Former model Cheryl Tiegs blasts Sports Illustrated full-figured swimsuit cover","link":"http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2016/02/26/Former-model-Cheryl-Tiegs-blasts-Sports-Illustrated-full-figured-swimsuit-cover/6101456469151/","summary":"LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26 (UPI) -- Former model Cheryl Tiegs blasted the new swimsuit edition of Sports Illustrated because she thinks cover model Ashley Graham&#39;s full figure is not healthy.
