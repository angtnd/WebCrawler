the waterproof design and expandable storage of the Galaxy S5 to make two beautiful and durable new smartphones.</p>","<p>But the S7 and S7 Edge donât just rehash old ideas. They also bring a host of new and interesting features. That combination of new meets the best of the old make these not just the best smartphones Samsung has ever built â but, in my opinion, the best smartphones you can buy right now.</p>","<p>Hereâs why.</p>","<h2>Design and size</h2>","<p>OK, yeah, the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge look a <i>lot</i> like their predecessors, the S6 and S6 Edge. And while the Edge has a larger display this time around, most people would have trouble telling the new and old models apart.</p>","<p>Thatâs not necessarily a bad thing, though. The S6 and S6 Edge were beautiful phones, and so are the S7 and S7 Edge. And remember that Apple regularly recycles the body designs of its iPhones in a two-year cycle, using the second year to update the handsetsâ guts, before coming out with a new exterior the year after that. Thatâs the same game Samsung appears to be playing here.</p>","<figure width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/2df2ba8240c3922948dd39fe143265cb/tumblr_inline_o3pce9pAeo1r19dv9_540.jpg\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/hNQEhFMB_3VxuEhLtS8Q1w--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTAwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/2df2ba8240c3922948dd39fe143265cb/tumblr_inline_o3pcsiGT7A1r19dv9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/2df2ba8240c3922948dd39fe143265cb/tumblr_inline_o3pce9pAeo1r19dv9_540.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Like the S6 and S6 Edge, the S7 and S7 Edge come wrapped in metal frames with glass-coated rear panels. Those rear panels look great, though I must point out that they are also âmagnetsâ for fingerprint smudges.</p>","<p>Unlike last yearâs models, the S7 and S7 Edge have contoured rear panels that make them more comfortable to hold. Samsung has also reduced the size of the phonesâ camera bumps, making them more flush with the handsetsâ bodies.</p>","<p>Measuring 5.6 x 2.7 x 0.31 inches, the S7 is nearly identical to the S6 in terms of size, and is a bit thicker and taller than the iPhone 6s â but Samsungâs handset does offer a larger screen.</p>","<p>The Galaxy S7 Edge, on the other hand, is much larger than the S6 Edge, measuring 5.9 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches, which accommodates its bigger 5.5-inch screen. Still, the S7 Edge is shorter than the iPhone 6s Plus (6.2 x 3.1 x 0.29 inches) which also has a 5.5-inch screen.</p>","<h2>Dare to get wet</h2>","<p>Water is usually a death sentence for smartphones. A few years ago, Samsung solved this problem by making its Galaxy S5 waterproof. But when the S6 came out, Samsung for some reason removed that incredibly helpful feature.</p>","<p>Thankfully, the company came to its senses and brought waterproofing back for the S7 and S7 Edge. Both phones can survive in up to five feet of water for up to 30 minutes and emerge unscathed.</p>","<p>I put both phones in a large container of water, and when I pulled them out, they still worked perfectly.Â Whatâs more impressive is that the S7 and S7 Edge donât have any unsightly port covers to keep them safe from water.Â </p>","<p>This is a super-practical feature every smartphone should offer.Â Now if only Apple would get the message.</p>","<h2>Beautiful screens</h2>","<p>Samsungâs smartphones generally sport some of the best-looking displays you can find, and the S7 and S7 Edge are no different. The Galaxy S7 comes with a 5.1-inch, 2560 x 1440 resolution Super AMOLED display, while the S7 Edge gets a 5.5-inch version of the same screen.</p>","<p>Super AMOLED (active matrix of organic light-emitting diodes) displays are known for offering striking colors and deep blacks (though, by the same token, their colors can sometimes look abnormally oversaturated). By comparison, Appleâs iPhone Retina HD screens tend to produce colors that, while brilliant, are slightly flatter â and, as a result, more natural-looking â than what youâll see on Samsung phones. I happen to prefer vibrant colors, so I also prefer Samsungâs screens.</p>","<figure width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/8c4d7ec394e6b203a859cff726c0ad17/tumblr_inline_o3pceoNYZO1r19dv9_540.jpg\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/1QB1G5huE9wGAyzZGr2OOg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTAwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/8c4d7ec394e6b203a859cff726c0ad17/tumblr_inline_o3pcsiHNUs1r19dv9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/8c4d7ec394e6b203a859cff726c0ad17/tumblr_inline_o3pceoNYZO1r19dv9_540.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p>For the S7 and S7 Edge, Samsung has introduced the always-on display. As the name implies, these displays are, well, always on. Whenever the phone is locked, the screen will show things like the time, date, battery level, your calendar or an image like a night sky on a largely black background. You can also see notifications for things like texts and missed calls.</p>","<p>I set the screen to show the time, and sat it down on my desk to act as my desk clock. I found that to be surprisingly helpful, as it meant I didnât have to constantly grab my phone and wake it up just to check the time.</p>","<p>Because that AMOLED technology actually turns off individual pixels to display blacks (instead of keeping them lit), this always-on feature shouldnât eat through the phonesâ batteries. In fact, the company claims it will use just 1 percent of your handsetâs battery life.</p>","<p>If, however, you donât want to risk even a tiny loss of battery power, you can always turn off the feature altogether in the Settings menu.</p>","<h2>Bleeding edge</h2>","<p>The biggest difference between the S7 and S7 Edge is the latterâs curved Edge screen. Like the S6 Edge, the S7 Edgeâs display cascades off its left and right sides, giving the appearance of a completely edgeless display. Itâs really quite beautiful.</p>","<figure width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://36.media.tumblr.com/9a1e039c76c278dafdfb7a70bfee7f08/tumblr_inline_o3pcexfaUX1r19dv9_540.jpg\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/NEcnNCrFcaRg0Y1fd7y.mQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTAwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/9a1e039c76c278dafdfb7a70bfee7f08/tumblr_inline_o3pcsiyzz11r19dv9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://36.media.tumblr.com/9a1e039c76c278dafdfb7a70bfee7f08/tumblr_inline_o3pcexfaUX1r19dv9_540.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p>With the S6 Edge, the curved screen was frankly more of a gimmick than anything. But with the S7 Edge, the Edge display is far more functional. By swiping in from either side of the screen you can pull up a list of your favorite apps or select specific tasks (such as texting particular people or opening the camera to take a selfie).</p>","<p>News stories, sports scores, and stock prices summoned this way also appear larger (and, so, easier to read). With the S6 Edge, those things were shown as a scrolling ticker that ran along the Edge display. Now theyâre big boxes with images and readable text. </p>","<figure width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://36.media.tumblr.com/d8e19b97766cc94351b5952aab3dee2b/tumblr_inline_o3pch59JV91r19dv9_540.jpg\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/mrcBSVfPlFxIiUUMI5SbXw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTAwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/d8e19b97766cc94351b5952aab3dee2b/tumblr_inline_o3pcskuKGO1r19dv9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://36.media.tumblr.com/d8e19b97766cc94351b5952aab3dee2b/tumblr_inline_o3pch59JV91r19dv9_540.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p>All of which is to say that the S7 Edgeâs Edge display is extremely useful in its current incarnation. My one problem with it is that, when I type a message using one hand, my palm ends up hitting the curved portion of the screen, causing me to press a button I didnât mean to. You can imagine how annoying that can be after a while.</p>","<h2>Take pictures anywhere</h2>","<p>The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge both come with 12-megapixel rear cameras, just like the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Samsungâs new cameras actually have fewer megapixels than the 16-megapixel shooters found on the S6 and S6 Edge. </p>","<p>Thatâs not exactly a downgrade, though, as the S7 and S7 Edgeâs pixels are larger than their predecessors. As a result, Samsung says the S7 and S7 Edgeâs cameras can capture more light, which makes for clearer, more colorful images.</p>","<figure width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/dbf5f54763eade76fca42a87fd6f939c/tumblr_inline_o3pcff6YOb1r19dv9_540.jpg\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/bTJFomVqMvj7_EHUYALfvA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTAwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/dbf5f54763eade76fca42a87fd6f939c/tumblr_inline_o3pcsllrze1r19dv9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/dbf5f54763eade76fca42a87fd6f939c/tumblr_inline_o3pcff6YOb1r19dv9_540.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p>That said, when I compared shots taken outside and in my office with the S6 to those taken with the S7, I didnât notice much of a difference. </p>","<p>But compared to photos taken with the iPhone 6s Plus, the Galaxy S7âs shots seemed to offer more saturated colors and slightly sharper details (though, to be honest, youâll have to zoom in on your pictures to see any appreciable difference).

A picture I took of my lounging cat with the S7 was far brighter and offered more details than the same shot taken on the iPhone 6s Plus.

Both phones have high-powered processors and 4 GB of RAM, which means apps run buttery smooth. I was especially impressed with how quickly the S7 and S7 Edgeâs fingerprint readers unlock the phones.</p>","<p>But the one feature that will have hardcore smartphone users jumping with joy is the return of expandable storage. Yep, when you run out of space on your S7, you donât have to worry about deleting a bunch of photos and apps to make more room. </p>","<figure width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/545d4885ad2d9018d12aecfa5186a2eb/tumblr_inline_o3pcgkZUCj1r19dv9_540.jpg\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/AWvo7YHFqfrGxnXeauU1fA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTAwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/545d4885ad2d9018d12aecfa5186a2eb/tumblr_inline_o3pcsmlK521r19dv9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\" height=\"450\" data-orig-src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/545d4885ad2d9018d12aecfa5186a2eb/tumblr_inline_o3pcgkZUCj1r19dv9_540.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p>Instead, you can just slide a microSD card into the handset and add up to 200 GB of storage. Thatâs a big benefit, especially if you take a lot of pictures or download movies to watch on the go.</p>","<p>In terms of battery life, the S7 and S7 Edge come with 3,000-mAh and 3,600-mAh power plants, respectively. Thatâs a nice upgrade over the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, which came with 2,550-mAh and 2,600-mAh batteries. That means the S7 and S7 Edge should get you through your day and then some without needing to be recharged. Â </p>","<h2>Software with a bit of bloat</h2>","<p>Both the S7 and S7 Edge run the latest version of Googleâs Android Marshmallow operating system with Samsungâs TouchWiz skin running on top. </p>","<p>In previous years, I would have bemoaned Samsungâs decision to alter Android by adding its own app icons and certain interface changes. But ever since releasing the Galaxy S6, Samsung has cut back on how much of its own mark it puts on Android with its interface. The result is a relatively slick interface that is easy to navigate without being overbearing or holding your hand too much.</p>","<p>The biggest problem I have with the S7 software is the huge number of unwanted apps (a.k.a. bloatware) that come preinstalled. In addition to Googleâs usual slew of apps, Samsung installs its own offerings, including its Milk Music service and a host of Amazon apps. My S7 and S7 Edge also came with eight different Verizon apps. I <i>hate</i> preinstalled apps, but companies just keep adding more and more of them.</p>","<h2>The bottom line</h2>","<p>Despite these quibbles, however, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge are easily the best smartphones you can currently buy. They are beautiful, waterproof and capture fantastic photos. </p>","<p>Between the S7 and S7 Edge, though, Iâd suggest opting for the S7, simply because itâs less expensive. Sure the Edge is more attractive, and its expanded screen makes opening apps easier. But at $792 for my Verizon version, it costs $120 more than the regular S7. If cost isnât an issue, go ahead and splurge for the Edge. Either way, you wonât be disappointed.</p>","<p><i>Email Daniel at <a href=\"mailto:dhowley@yahoo-inc.com\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">dhowley@yahoo-inc.com</a>; follow him on Twitter

The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lions/status/707234454163623936\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">team announced</a> his decision on Tuesday morning. The Lions said Johnson filed his retirement papers and his contractual matters \"<span>were settled to the satisfaction of the parties.â</span></p>","<p><span>So that's that. The Lions, for the second time in less than 20 years, have seen an all-time great player step away from the game suddenly. First it was running back Barry Sanders. Now it's Johnson. </span></p>","<p><span>The rumors have been circulating about Johnson for a long time this offseason, and many have focused on his health. Johnson has been banged up the past few years and reportedly didn't want to keep putting his body through the rigors of being an NFL player. One also has to wonder if the constant losing played a part. For as great as Johnson was individually, he played in the playoffs just twice in nine seasons. The Lions lost in their first playoff game both times. </span></p>","<p><span>That isn't Johnson's fault. He did everything he could. He walks away at age 30 with 731 catches, 11,619 yards and 83 touchdowns in just nine seasons. He set the NFL's single-season receiving yardage record, with 1,964 yards in 2012. The second overall pick of the 2007 draft set a new bar for big, physical receivers. He was a marvelous player, even if he ended up playing in obscurity too often because of the franchise he was with. </span></p>","<p><span>And with that he's gone. Once again the Lions have lost a future Hall of Fame player too soon to retirement. </span></p>","<p><span>Johnson, who never embraced publicity during his career, made a statement <a href=\"http://www.detroitlions.com/news/article-1/Statement-from-Calvin-Johnson/bb88f791-0815-42a1-9195-8786e332a224\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">through the team's website </a>rather than have a press conference to announce his retirement: </span></p>"],"remaining_body":["<blockquote> \n <p><span><span>âLet me begin by apologizing for making this announcement via a statement and not in person.

It also wanted additional time to comply.</p>","<p>If the council votes to approve the agreement without changes, the lawsuit against the city would be resolved.</p>","<p>The agreement requires the police department to give officers bias-awareness training and implement an accountability system. The city also agreed that police must ensure that stop, search and arrest practices do not discriminate on the basis of race or other factors protected under law. </p>","<p>The settlement also requires the city to change its municipal code, including sections that impose prison time for failure to pay certain fines.</p>","<br>","<p> (Reporting by Sue Britt; Writing by Ben Klayman; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)</p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"news","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","width":"450","ratio":68,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/OThE4uvIFc8KzPxpi8GluQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0xO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2016-03-08T121150Z_1_LYNXNPEC270PT_RTROPTP_2_FERGUSON-ANNIVERSARY.JPG.cf.jpg","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/MNqxGoqZlWLAgLFNqKencQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz00NTA7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2016-03-08T121150Z_1_LYNXNPEC270PT_RTROPTP_2_FERGUSON-ANNIVERSARY.JPG.cf.jpg","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[{"caption":"A protester yells at a police line shortly before shots were fired in a police-officer involved shooting in Ferguson, Missouri August 9, 2015.

/></span></span></span></span>Fox News host Bret Baier grilled Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server during her first appearance on the network in more than two years on Monday. <p>In a network town-hall event, Baier pressed Clinton at length about her use of a private email server while she was the US secretary of state.</p> <p>\"The FBI investigation is still hanging over your campaign, and there are some Democrats who are worried about the other shoe dropping,\" Baier said.</p> <p>The former secretary of state vigorously refuted claims that her past statements about sharing classifiedÂ information on her private server were inaccurate.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of misinformation going on around here, so let me start with the facts,\" Clinton said.</p> <p>Last March, facingÂ <span>criticism for exclusively using a private server during her time as secretary of state, Clinton handed over about 30,000 work-related emails for the State Department to make public. She deleted about 31,000 more emails she says were personal in nature. Since then, many of the released emails have been marked classified upon their release.</span></p> <p>Clinton reiterated that she believed she made a \"mistake\" in using a personal email account instead of an official government account. But she argued thatÂ none of the emails she sent or received were marked classifiedÂ at the time.</p> <p>\"I have said it wasn't the best choice to use a personal email. It was a mistake,\" Clinton said. \"However, I am not alone in that. Many people in the government, past and current, have on occasion or in practice have done the same.\"</p> <p>Baier then confronted Clinton about the classification process itself, asking whether she believed the since-redacted emails even needed to be classified.</p> <p>\"So your contention now is the 2,100 or so emails should not have been classified at any time, now or then?\" Baier asked.</p> <p>Clinton, disagreed, but called for the emails to be released.</p> <p>\"Release it, and once the American people see it, they will see how absurd this is,\" Clinton said, spurring applause in the audience.</p> <p>NOW WATCH: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ted-cruz-slams-donald-trump-fox-news-hillary-clinton-2016-3\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">TRUMP: Here's why I supported Hillary Clintonâs 2008 presidential run</a></p><br /><br /><b>More From Business Insider </b><br />\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-to-turn-over-private-email-server-2015-8\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Hillary Clinton is turning over her server to the feds amid revelations of 'top secret' emails</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-on-her-private-email-server-i-had-little-to-do-with-it-2015-9\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Hillary Clinton on her private email server: I had little to do with it</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-email-server-intelligence-agencies-classified-2015-7\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Intelligence officials: Hillary Clinton's private server contained information from 5 US spy agencies</a><br /></li>\n  </ul></p> </p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"cf75ce78-db19-3323-920a-f10aa11e43eb","licensed":"true","title":"Watch The Penguin Who Swims 5,000 Miles To See His Human Pal Every Year","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/watch-the-penguin-who-swims-5000-miles-to-see-his-100012671.html","summary":"It began in 2011, when retired bricklayer Joao Pereira de Souza, 71, rescued a South American Magellanic penguin on a fishing village island off Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.

Then she continued to follow the traditional career path by taking a job selling telecommunications services to small businesses.</p> <p>When she moved on to a position in marketing and social media, she realized it was \"another experience of creating money out of thin air,\" she says. \"I knew if you called enough people and talked to enough people, you could create money and opportunity out of nothing.\"</p> <p>When her daughter was born in 2012, Romans took on a side gig in the form of a lifestyle blog, sharing her life, relationship, and experiences in early motherhood with readers. \"I had these days where I'd have like 50,000 hits and crazy traffic, and I'd call my husband at work and be like, 'Somethingâs working,'\" she recalls.</p> <p>When her son was born two years later, Romans realized it was time to reevaluate. \"I was like, here I am with two kids, a corporate career, a blog that's blowing up â something's gotta give, I'm going to go nuts here!\" she says. \"I had all this experience, and this blog that was getting traffic, and I didn't know what to do with it. I didn't have a business model.\"</p> <p>For years, she had been managing social-media sites for small, local businesses on a retainer of about $350 a month, and thanks to her connections in the business community and her corporate expertise in sales and marketing, she figured she should be able to sign some clients on her own as a consultant should she leave her corporate job.</p> <p>Romans remembers friends and coworkers thinking she was delusional to quit a good, steady job. \"I had it made,\" she says. \"They were paying me well, I could work from home, and I was getting bonuses, but there was something greater.

I felt like I needed more than that for my lifestyle, for childcare, for a house. I had this whole family and aspirations of doing things on a bigger scale.\" <p>In late spring 2014, she pulled the plug on her day job. \"I just thought, I know I'm capable of doing more,\" Romans remembers. \"I think this girl can make more money on her own than under this company. I'm a risk-taker â I didn't have a savings plan, I had the mortgage, but I thought I should be able to bring in about $3,000, $4,000 a month on my own.\"</p> <p>She based that number on figures she had gleaned from other coaches and consultants who shared their numbers. \"I realized people were paid more for the consulting than the implementation,\" she says. \"I'm thinking, 'I can actually do all this stuff, but actually consultants get paid more.'\"</p> <p>She started by ramping down her lifestyle blog and buying her domain name, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://susieromans.com/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">SusieRomans.com</a>. She bundled some of her insights into $500 packages, branding herself as an online-marketing expert based on the results from the blog she had run for years. She started promoting to local business owners and seizing opportunities anywhere she could, taking speaking engagements everywhere from libraries to the Chamber of Commerce.</p> <p>\"In 90 days, I had a $10,000 month,\" she says. \"That was when everyone around me â my family thought I was a lunatic, doing this with two babies â that's when everyone's eyebrows raised.

In a further upsurge in violence, al Qaeda's Nusra Front and other Islamist insurgents not included in the U.S.-Russian agreement attacked government forces in a neighboring province, taking over a village and at least two hilltops in their first advance for some time in the area, a monitoring group said. The agreement, accepted by President Bashar al-Assad's government and most of his enemies, has reduced violence in Syria since it took effect on Feb 27, the first truce of its kind in a 5-year-old war that has killed more than 250,000 people and caused the world's worst refugee crisis.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ALquYN13HdNZP3dlX6zyA--/aD0xNTM0O3c9MjMwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/1fb6c579b144bc0a910f6a706700fe67.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"2301","height":"1534"}},{"followId":"1e8b6b22-e49d-11e5-8775-fa163e2c24a6","name":"Maria Sharapova","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"7e74e780-5da3-3a70-8687-275d1a754479","cluster_id":"1e8b6b22-e49d-11e5-8775-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Maria Sharapova failed a drug test at Australian Open","link":"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/tennis-busted-racquet/maria-sharapova-major-announcement-192521679.html","image_assets":[{"width":"3264","height":"2448","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Lg8yxG2jbWse81K4GX_A_g--/aD0yNDQ4O3c9MzI2NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-697998865.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1nj4UJ4_xmjgjTqOoraaAw--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-697998865.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tK_74.T6wxtiSuNaYsMKEg--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-697998865.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-03-08T16:02:27Z","summary":"Maria Sharapova did not indicate what the penalties would be or how long she might be away from the game of tennis.","publisher":"Busted Racquet"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0g4nq9Lb.4a7.XWWecF4WQ--/aD0yMTM1O3c9MjkwNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2016-03-07T201911Z_386495997_GF10000337157_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-SHARAPOVA.JPG","tag":"size=original","width":"2905","height":"2135"}},{"followId":"0d628734-b637-11e5-a390-fa163e2c24a6","name":"'El Chapo' recaptured","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"8302a2c4-5cbc-36c1-948f-71d2133a0fb0","cluster_id":"0d628734-b637-11e5-a390-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Ukrainians picket Russian embassy over detained pilot","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/calls-grow-russia-release-ukrainian-pilot-savchenko-110224626.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1024","height":"647","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/upjdBlFn9YwgCzpsEPnWzw--/aD02NDc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--578763457.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x0_kReZFL9c.ykC4fHdB9A--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--578763457.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ETTTxdhrwXdRvxWLHmZifA--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--578763457.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-03-08T16:02:10Z","summary":"Hundreds of angry Ukrainians picketed Moscow's embassy in Kiev on Tuesday as global calls grew for the release of a hunger-striking military helicopter pilot on trial in Russia.
