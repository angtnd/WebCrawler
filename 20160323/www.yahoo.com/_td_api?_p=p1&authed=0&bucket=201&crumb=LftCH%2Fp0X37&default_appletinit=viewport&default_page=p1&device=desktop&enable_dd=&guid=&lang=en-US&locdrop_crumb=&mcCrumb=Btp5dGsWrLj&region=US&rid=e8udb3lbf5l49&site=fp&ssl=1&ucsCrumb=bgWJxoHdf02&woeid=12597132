The results have consistently found that many workers have a shaky faith in their financial futures, and their actual financial preparation is even worse. Now, in its newly released <a href=\"https://www.ebri.org/https:/www.ebri.org/surveys/rcs/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">26th survey</a>, EBRIâs latest findings show that savings progress has plateauedâand the divide between those who are on track and those falling behind is as stark as ever.</p>","<p>No question, most Americans still have the potential to rescue their retirements. But as these five charts show, many workers face stiff headwindsâespecially those who lack the benefits of 401(k)s or are unable to take the necessary financial planning steps. The data are likely to add more fuel to the <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4249089/coming-battle-retirement-security/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">national debate</a> over Americaâs retirement security.

Retirement confidence is leveling off.</span></p>","<p>The good news is that compared to the record lows in confidence between 2009 and 2013, which followed the financial crisis, a larger percentage of Americans are feeling better about their finances. More than one out of five workers say they are âvery confidentâ about their ability to retire comfortably. Those who felt âsomewhat confidentâ increased, while fewer said they were not at all confident.</p>","<hr> \n <p><span style=\"color: black; text-align: left; font: Georgia; font-size: 26px; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px; border: none;\">2. Thereâs a big gap between those who have a retirement plan and those that donât.</span></p> \n <p>As the EBRI data show, the most telling marker of retirement confidence is participation in a retirement plan, whether a 401(k), traditional defined benefit pension plan, or an IRA. Among workers who reported that they or their spouse had money in one of these plans, a whopping 26% were very confident about retirement vs. just 10% of those without a planâthatâs more than twice as confident.</p> \n <hr> \n  <p><span style=\"color: black; text-align: left; font: Georgia; font-size: 26px; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px; border: none;\">3. Retirement confidence far outpaces retirement savings.</span></p> \n  <p>In a persistent display of cognitive dissonance, most Americans are falling behind in their savings, despite their improved confidence levels. Overall, 63% of workers and their spouses say they are currently putting away money for retirement. But 54% had amassed little in savingsâless than $25,000. Only 26% reported assets of $100,000 or more. Among the reasons for lack of savings, 40% cited daily expenses and 11% said they were paying off debt. As you might expect, having a retirement plan made a difference. More than two-thirds of those without a plan had less than $1,000 stashed away. Yet most workers say they need to accumulate $250,000 or more to retire comfortably.</p> \n  <hr> \n   <p><span style=\"color: black; text-align: left; font: Georgia; font-size: 26px; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px; border: none;\">4. Most workers have not taken basic retirement planning steps. </span></p> \n   <p>Only 48% have even tried to figure out how much theyâll need to have saved by the time they stop working, a percentage that is only incrementally better than last yearâs. Even fewer have calculated how much theyâll get in Social Security benefits or the future costs of their health care expenses. Thatâs particularly discouraging given the boom in low-cost <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3746328/robo-advisers-betterment-wealthfront/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">online financial advice</a>. But as survey data elsewhere shows, only 2% of workers and 1% of retirees are very interested in getting such advice online. (Give it a tryâyou can see what your savings will grow to .)</p> \n   <p>Â </p> \n   <hr> \n    <p><span style=\"color: black; text-align: left; font: Georgia; font-size: 26px; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px; border: none;\">5. Many workers expect to work past traditional retirement age. </span></p> \n    <p>Some 17% of current workers say their expected retirement age has changed, with 77% of that group saying it had increased. In addition, some 6% of workers say theyâll never retire. Better not count on that. The average retiree typically stops working around 62. Unexpected illness, job loss, family care-giving needs, and other hardships consistently cause nearly half of all workers to retire sooner than expected.<strong><br /></strong></p> \n    <p>You might think that given the lack of savings, Americans would be counting heavily on Social Security and Medicare to help fund their shortfalls. Not so much. Only about 10% of workers are very confident that future Social Security and Medicare benefits will equal those now received by retirees. About 55% to 60% are either not too confident or not at all confident that benefit levels can be maintained. Fortunately, Social Security at least is in <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4213065/will-social-security-run-out-money/?xid=homepage\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">better shape</a> than the average Americanâs finances.</p> \n    <hr> \n     <p><em>Philip Moeller is an expert on retirement, aging, and health.

When he's happy, he's going to express himself, when he's sad he's going to express himself too.</p>","<p>\"So I think we just need to accept, understand or at least anticipate we're not going to get him at his best.\"</p>","<p>(Newton received plenty of criticism for the way he expressed himself when he was happy too, so he'll never win over some folks.)</p>","<p>When reporters told Rivera that Newton should act like a professional regardless of circumstances, Rivera understood the sentiment. He believes, however, that media coverage of Newton does not give a true reflection of who Newton is, bringing up the extensive work the quarterback does in the community.</p>","<p>\"Nobody understands those things or celebrates those things. But do something wrong, slip up, don't be the person everybody wants you to be and everybody gets upset,\" Rivera said. \"How about understanding who he is? Spend a week with him and be in his shoes for a week and see what it's like. It's hard. I promise you, it's hard.\"</p>","<p>Himself a former player, Rivera noted that other superstar athletes, like LeBron James, struggled to publicily deal with adversity early in their careers, and brought up another NBA icon as well.</p>","<p>\"Think about Jerry West and the way he was and how much of a bad loser he was. I mean, Mr. West was one of the most tremendous athletes ever but yet he struggled with losing,\" Rivera said. \"So let's all take a second to really think about this is not a unique set of circumstances. This is the true raw emotion of who he is. Let's celebrate that, too. Let's not pile on.\"</p>","<p>Newton likely already knew his coach had his back, but Wednesday offered another example of how passionately Rivera will defend his star QB.</p>","<p></p>"]},"property":"sports","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"52151b75-e8fe-30a3-ba2f-6a16cfdc7478","licensed":"true","title":"People are rallying around a Burger King ad after the Brussels terrorist attacks","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/people-rallying-around-burger-king-190655572.html","summary":"A Burger King ad has become an unlikely symbol of solidarity against terrorists.

Curry hoped to be given a youth basketball camp, like many of the NBA's biggest stars, but didn't get one. When it came to the meeting, Nike dropped the ball by mispronouncing Curry's first name and messing up a slide in a presentation:</p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">The pitch meeting, according to Steph's father Dell, who was present, kicked off with one Nike official accidentally addressing Stephen as \"Steph-on,\" the moniker, of course, of Steve Urkel's alter ego in Family Matters. \"I heard some people pronounce his name wrong before,\" says Dell Curry. \"I wasn't surprised. I was surprised that I didn't get a correction.\"</p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">It got worse from there. A PowerPoint slide featured <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Kevin Durant</a>'s name, presumably left on by accident, presumably residue from repurposed materials. \"I stopped paying attention after that,\" Dell says. Though Dell resolved to \"keep a poker face,\" throughout the entirety of the pitch, the decision to leave Nike was in the works.</p> <p>According to Dell, it was also clear that Nike was placing Curry in a category below their top stars like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Kobe Bryant.</p> <p>Few people saw Curry's rise coming, and it's possible that Nike didn't value Curry as highly as their other superstars. When Under Armour, after wiggling their way into Curry's view, as Strauss explains, offered a contract worth a little under $4 million per year, Nike didn't match.</p> <p>Now, Under Armour, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/under-armour-executive-explains-factors-they-look-for-when-signing-athletes-2016-3\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">which boasts an impressive collection of athletes</a>, is coming after Nike, and Curry is leading the charge. Sonny Vaccaro, a former sports marketing executive who worked with Nike, told Strauss of Nike losing Curry, \"This is Nike's biggest fear. They can't overcome this in the shoe business. This is going to be detrimental to them. Psychologically.\"</p> <p>NOW WATCH: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/snowmobiler-takes-over-st-paul-2016-3\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">This snowmobiler tore across St. Paul and performed some epic stunts along the way</a></p><br /><br /><b>More From Business Insider </b><br />\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-beat-the-golden-state-warriors-2016-3\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">It's becoming clear that there's one potential formula for beating the Golden State Warriors</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/carmelo-anthony-restless-as-knicks-hit-crossroads-2016-3\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Carmelo Anthony is starting to sound restless, and the Knicks are about to hit a crossroads</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ncaa-tournament-shoe-brands-2016-3\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Nike's grip on the NCAA Tournament is slipping</a><br /></li>\n  </ul></p> </p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"false","id":"80d4d9ed-4324-3baf-bb92-6e0b137d30d9","categoryLabel":"Entertainment","cluster_id":"ec868fd5-085c-35bd-9805-fa38b51a0b9b","licensed":"false","title":"Donald Trump threatens to &#39;spill the beans&#39; on Ted Cruz&#39;s wife over Melania ad","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/03/22/melania-trump-gq-ted-cruz/","summary":"The race for the Republican nomination has devolved into a war over wives.
