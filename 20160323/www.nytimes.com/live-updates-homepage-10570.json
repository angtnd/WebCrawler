Reminder for a Belgian Muslim Playwright","status":"publish","type":"nyt_live_update","author":86,"content":"[nytmedia id=\"100000004288183\" crop=\"480\" type=\"image\"]\n\nSince last year, \u201cDjihad,\u201d the Belgian playwright Isma\u00ebl Saidi\u2019s comic play about three hapless Belgian Muslims who travel to Syria, has been packing houses across Belgium and fueling discussion about homegrown Islamic radicalism and discontented youth.\n\nBut the terrorist attacks in Brussels, which included the suicide bombing of a central subway station, hit especially close to home for Mr. Saidi: His 16-year-old son had taken the subway that morning.\n\n\u201cI was watching the news, then I heard about the subway and I thought about my son,\u201d Mr. Saidi said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cI tried to reach him for 20 or 30 minutes.\u201d\n\nFinally, the two connected. \u201cHe had exited the subway just one stop before,\u201d Mr. Saidi said. \u201cSo we\u2019re very lucky.\u201d\n\nMr. Saidi said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the attacks, which killed at least 31 people and wounded 270 others. \n\n\u201cWe all were waiting for something like this to happen,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same feeling as looking through the window when a storm is coming,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of sadness and anger because you know that maybe we could have done something. You never know.\u201d\n\nMr. Saidi, 39, a former Brussels policeman and a practicing Muslim, is one of the three actors in \u201cDjihad.\u201d \n\nThey performed the play the night before the attacks. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the weird part for us as artists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about three guys going to Syria to do jihad who then go back to Brussels and are involved in an attack.\u201d\n\nPlans were already in place for the tour to resume in April in Belgium and France. \n\nThe play uses a light, humane approach to touch on Islamic radicalism, anti-Semitism, joblessness and hopelessness among young Muslim men in Belgium, which has a high per capita number of citizens leaving to fight in Syria. \n\n\u201cDjihad\u201d was broadcast on Belgian television just after the Paris attacks last November. Mr. Saidi said that more than 47,000 people had seen it live since it first opened in December 2014, including 25,000 high school students.\n\nA Flemish version is now on tour with a different cast, and the play has also been translated into English.\n\n\u201cThey adore it,\u201d Mr. Saidi said of the students. \n\nAfter the play, he often holds discussions with the students, the actors and guest imams and journalists.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about terrorism, about a lot of stuff they cannot talk about in the classroom,\u201d Mr. Saidi said. \u201cWhen they see the news it\u2019s not easy to talk about it with their parents.\u201d\n\nBelgian politicians have been eager to champion the play. But after receiving government support for the school performances, in January Mr. Saidi turned down the funding, fearing that his artistic independence was being caught up in Belgian politics. \n\nIn his memoir, \u201cMoi, Isma\u00ebl, un musulman d\u2019ici\u201d (\u201cMe, Isma\u00ebl, a Muslim From Here\u201d), Mr. Saidi talks about growing up in a rough area of Brussels. \n\nHis father, who immigrated to Belgium from Morocco in the 1960s and worked as a taxi driver, urged him to attend a good high school in a better neighborhood.\n\nThat was where \u201cI found out that white people exist,\u201d he said. \u201cAll my friends, and even me, if we were saved, it was because of education.\u201d\n\nMr. Saidi said he did not believe in \u201cde-radicalization,\u201d but in preventing people from becoming radical. \n\n\u201cThe first part is education inside the family,\" he said. \"The way Muslims teach Islam to their kids has to change. And the second part is education in schools.

You never know.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Mr. Saidi, 39, a former Brussels policeman and a practicing Muslim, is one of the three actors in \u201cDjihad.\u201d <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">They performed the play the night before the attacks. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cThat\u2019s the weird part for us as artists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about three guys going to Syria to do jihad who then go back to Brussels and are involved in an attack.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Plans were already in place for the tour to resume in April in Belgium and France. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The play uses a light, humane approach to touch on Islamic radicalism, anti-Semitism, joblessness and hopelessness among young Muslim men in Belgium, which has a high per capita number of citizens leaving to fight in Syria. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cDjihad\u201d was broadcast on Belgian television just after the Paris attacks last November. Mr. Saidi said that more than 47,000 people had seen it live since it first opened in December 2014, including 25,000 high school students.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">A Flemish version is now on tour with a different cast, and the play has also been translated into English.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cThey adore it,\u201d Mr. Saidi said of the students. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">After the play, he often holds discussions with the students, the actors and guest imams and journalists.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cWe\u2019re talking about terrorism, about a lot of stuff they cannot talk about in the classroom,\u201d Mr. Saidi said. \u201cWhen they see the news it\u2019s not easy to talk about it with their parents.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Belgian politicians have been eager to champion the play.
