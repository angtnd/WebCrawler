Once, after leaving office, Fox called Venezuela's then-President Hugo Chavez a \"burro\" (years earlier Chavez had accused Fox of being a \"lapdog of the empire\").</p>","<p>That history wasn't lost on some Mexicans, like Jesus Pinon, a resident of the northern state of Chihuahua.</p>","<p>\"Vicente Fox says Donald Trump is a loudmouth, liar, ignorant and arrogant. Typical case of the donkey who talks about (someone else's) ears,\" Pinon, who uses the handle @JepsMeine, said via Twitter.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>And Jose Gilberto Diaz Perez, a businessman and retired electrical company worker in Mexico City, said the thought Fox was a terrible president: \"I trust Trump more than Fox.\"</p>","<p>But Federico Correch, a 32-year-old resident of the capital, appreciated that Fox stuck up for the country.</p>","<p>\"He's probably right because (Trump) doesn't know Mexicans well,\" Correch said. \"Donald Trump has said a lot about Mexicans when we have done many good things up there in the United States, no? He shouldn't express himself like that.\"</p>","<p>During Thursday night's Republican debate, Trump said Fox should be \"ashamed\" of such language â despite the candidate having mouthed the same word at a New Hampshire rally and used it several times in a 2011 speech before he was a candidate â and demanded an apology.</p>","<p>But Fox was having none of it the following day as he gave a series of interviews to Mexican media in which he also criticized Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, but saved his most pointed barbs for the real-estate magnate.</p>","<p>\"This guy is an embarrassment to the Republican Party ... and his business colleagues,\" Fox told Imagen Radio, using another F-bomb to refer to the border wall.</p>","<p>\"He is empty and lacks substance ... for a nation like the United States,\" Fox said. Addressing Trump's supporters, he added: \"I ask you to open your eyes because this is a false prophet who will lead you to the precipice with all his ignorance.\"</p>","<p>\"I agree with all that,\" said Irma Martinez Aguinaga, a 75-year-old poet in Mexico City.</p>","<p>Trump \"wants to achieve his goals, well, may he do so,\" Martinez added. \"But without walking all over us or threatening us or saying he's going to do all kinds of things to us. That's not right.\"</p>","<p>___</p>","<p>Peter Orsi on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Peter_Orsi</p>"]},"property":"news"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"cba527d5-9efa-3a7e-9f6f-a557df40e884","licensed":"true","title":"Review: Eero is a pricey but effective fix for Wi-Fi dead spots","link":"https://www.yahoo.com/tech/eero-the-hero-a-pricey-end-to-wi-fi-dead-spots-192537160.html","summary":"America, itâs time to admit that we have a problem: We have Wi-Fi dead spots.

But I have a friend who lives inÂ a pre-war apartment in San Francisco, in which the walls are apparently made of concrete, lead, and Kryptonite.Â </p>","<p>Over the last five years, Iâve helped her try to solve her Wi-Fi problems several times. Weâve upgraded her router twice; installed a Wi-Fi extender; experimented with PowerLine adapters: <i>Nothing </i>worked.

The kitchen and dining room improvement? Network speeds went from 1.7 Mbps to 79 Mbps â almost miraculous.</p>","<h2>Whatâs not to like</h2>","<p>So: The Eero is small, attractive, idiot-proof, fast, and it <i>works. </i></p>","<p>As a bonus, when someone comes over to your house, you donât have to remember the password; you can send them a link via email or text message containing the networkÂ name and password â either for the main network, or a separate guest network that doesnât have access to the rest of your computers.<br /></p>","<p>Eero is not, however, a slam dunk for everyone. Some of the annoyances:</p>","<ul>\n <li>To get going, you have to create an Eero account, which includes disclosing your phone number. That seems a bit much.<br /></li>\n <li>The Eero app doesnât work when the Eeros arenât actually connected to the Internet. Why not? (I also found a couple of minor bugs in the app.)<br /></li>\n <li>The app prominently displays a speed test. Great! Unfortunately, it never changes as you move through the house. Eero explains that it shows the speed coming <i>into </i>the house â not the speed your laptop or phone is getting <i>within </i>the house, which would be far more useful.<br /></li>\n</ul>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NZ18vFrLdLi_S_GvwHhTHQ--/aD01OTY7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/bb35abc4ed291b1411468e83b96eabc3\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"596\" /></span>\n</figure>","<ul>\n <li>Despite the term âmesh network,â your devices (phone, tablet, or laptop) connect to only one Eero capsule at a time.Â The engineering achievement here, according to Eero, is the intelligence the capsules use to hand you off from one to the next as you move through the house. OK, but it would then be nice if the app indicated which capsule youâre connected to at a given moment, particularly when youâre troubleshooting.</li>\n <li>The app offers three generic screens with capsule-placement tips â âwithin 40 feet of each other,â âline of sight preferred,â and so on. But it doesnât do so <i>interactively, </i>tailoring those suggestions to <i>your </i>house as you fiddle with positioning.

You canât specify the security protocol (you get WPA2, AES encryption), the channels it uses, the frequency (it offers both 2.4 and 5.0 gigahertz), and so on. No parental controls, either.<br /></li>\n</ul>","<p>You might also be alarmed at first that there are only twoÂ Ethernet jacks onÂ the back of each Eero unit (plus a nonfunctional USB jack). Where are you supposed to plug inÂ yourÂ networkÂ hard drive, printer,Â cellphone booster, and so on?Â My old Netgear router hadÂ <i>four</i>Â Ethernet jacks.</p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6jvMqKKKa.ciTGmvAV8u6A--/aD0zMDc7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/280ccd5d2456f57e62d987011130057e\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"307\" /></span>\n</figure>","<p>Ahh, butÂ this isÂ actuallyÂ a benefit, at least in my setup.Â Because Eeros are now spread throughoutÂ the house, all of those additionalÂ network gadgets donâtÂ have to be clumped together nearÂ the router. Two apiece can be plugged into the Eeros in less conspicuous locations.</p>","<h2>Alternatives to Eero</h2>","<p>To appreciate the Eero â or to solve dead-spot problems with less expense â you could certainly try some alternatives:</p>","<p><b>Get a newer router:</b> If your current Wi-Fi router is more than a couple of years old, it doesnât have the latest technologies and so isnât delivering the best possible performance. Just replacing an old router could result in way better coverage.</p>","<p><b>Move your router:</b> Your instinct might be to tuck your router out of the way, because it looks so hideous. But the truth is, positioning your router up off the ground and as centrally as possible is much better.</p>","<p><b>Get an extender: </b>AÂ Wi-Fi extender (or repeater) grabs the weakening signal from your router and re-broadcasts it, giving it a boost into the farther reaches of your house. But you pay a price in speed with this technique, and the extended network has a different Wi-Fi name. (Instead of <i>My Network</i>, itâs something like <i>My Network_Ext.</i>) Having to switch back and forth manually between these different networks gets old fast.</p>","<p><b>Powerline adapters: </b><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-PA8010P-KIT-Pass-through-Powerline/dp/B00Y3QPG1A/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1456462136&sr=1-2&keywords=powerline\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">These modules</a> plug into power outlets and then use your homeâs electrical wiring asÂ network cabling; you connect your devices through their Ethernet jacks.Â Unfortunately, depending on your houseâs age, the quality of the wiring, number of circuits, proximity to big appliances, and so on,Â such networks are prone to interference and speed drops.</p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AdQrpRSjZB9McGxIzYn.Ww--/aD00MTM7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/2ed07a26a56c3553980a99286ee384b2\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"413\" /></span>\n</figure>","<p><b>Multiple routers, one name: </b>If you buy more than one router and give their networks <i>exactly </i>the same name and password, they automatically form a single big network. You avoid the two-network-names problem. </p>","<p>Apple actually <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202056\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">advertises this technique as a feature</a> of its AirPort base stations. (Other brands donât always work so well.)</p>","<p>This setup saves you having to manually switch networks as you move. Unfortunately, itâs up to your phone, tablet, or laptop to say, âGee, my first router signal is now so weak, I should start looking for a second oneâ â and, often, that doesnât happen until youâre well into the second routerâs territory.</p>","<p>In 802.11r networks like Eeroâs, however, the routers are smart enough to <i>tell </i>the device, âHey, thereâs a closer router now! Make the switch!â</p>","<p><b>Rival devices: </b>Eero is the first home 802.11r system, but others are on the way from D-Link, LinkSys, and others. Clearly, home 802.11r is going to be a thing.</p>","<h2>The bottom line</h2>","<p>Sometimes, time, beauty, reliability, and certainty are worth paying for. Thatâs why I ended up buying an Eero set for myself. My San Francisco friend also bought Eero â and canceled her electricianâs visit.</p>","<p>Thatâs two Eero systemsÂ sold alreadyâand a very good start for the dawn of high-speed mesh networks at home.</p>","<p><i>David Pogue is the founder of Yahoo Tech; <a href=\"http://j.mp/P4Qgnh\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">hereâs how to get his columns by email</a>.

With some planning and simple changes done ahead of time, weight loss is within reach, even for the busiest among us. Scheduling workouts, meal prep, or fridge arrangement can all make a big difference. We talked to Nina Olsen, owner of and personal trainer at <a href=\"http://www.mentalimagefitness.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Mental Image Fitness</a>, about her most common fitness advice for time-crunched clients.</p> 1. Plan and pack your lunch <p>ââPlan ahead, or plan to failâ is something I have always taught my clients,â says Olsen. âAlways plan and prepare your lunches and snacks in advance to avoid a nutrition mishap.â <a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/life/6-nutritious-brown-bag-lunches-to-bring-to-work.html/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Brown-bagging it</a> means you always have a healthy option, no matter how hectic your schedule gets.</p> <p>Along with numerous other trainers, Olsen recommends packing a weekâs worth of lunches on Sunday. That doesnât mean you have to pack the same lunch for every day; healthy and travel-friendly food is the key. With a weekâs worth of lunches ready to grab as youâre heading out the door, it wonât matter if you woke up late or a meeting goes long. A healthy meal will be right at your fingertips.</p> 2. Exercise with a buddy <p>After an extra long day or during early morning hours, it can be really hard to find the motivation to exercise. Knowing that you your friend is waiting for you is a good way to make sure that you get your workout in. âHaving a workout buddy is not only fun, but they will hold you accountable and keep you committed. Youâll build relationships with people that have like-minded goals, which keeps you coming back daily to achieve your own,â says Olsen.</p> <p>Try taking turns suggesting workouts and meeting times. Tackling your buddyâs routine may work muscles that you usually donât, or push you a little bit harder. Plus, by taking a new class or running a different route, you can provide the excitement or novelty that you need to stay interested in your commitment.</p> 3. Make healthy foods the most visible at home and at work<strong><br /> </strong> <p>If you come home from a long day at work starving and the first thing you see is a bag of chips, chances are thatâs what youâll grab. But the same is true if you walk in to see a bowl or oranges or bananas waiting. When you get home from the grocery store, arrange your fridge with your health goals in mind.</p> <p>âI know plenty of people who have great intentions when grocery shopping, but they donât realize that where theyâreÂ failing is in the prep. As soon as you come home from the grocery store, cut up all of your fruits and veggies right then and portion them out,â suggests Olsen. Keep your fresh fruit front and center. If itâs easier for you, cook any rice or quinoa that youâll be eating during the week ahead of time. The ease of pulling out and reheating a cooked, pre-portioned grain, rather than having to cook for an hour, will make mealtime much less stressful.</p> <p>The same goes for at work: On Mondays, bring in fresh fruit or pre-portioned nuts to snack on during the day. Hitting up the office candy stash wonât even cross your mind.</p> 4. Limit your alcohol: the one drink rule <p>Those nightly cocktail hours arenât doing your waist any favors, especially since most drinks are poured on the heavy side â meaning that âsingleâ is probably two servings of alcohol or wine. If you arenât ready to give it up completely, stick to one to two drinks.</p> <p>âI urge all of my clients to limit their consumption of alcohol, especially our athletes. Limiting yourself to only a drink or two at social events rather than daily might be that determining factor in your final 10 poundsÂ or more,â says Olsen. Any more than that and not only are you pounding down empty calories, youâre also putting yourself in the position to start binge eating.</p> <strong>5. Make time for exercise on the weekend</strong> <p>Family obligations and imposing work deadlines can make a good workout tough during the workweek, so always plan to put at least one serious workout on your weekend. âWeekends are the best time to really push yourself, as we generally have more time off work. Join a weekend boot camp or check out a class to keep you accountable on those weekends, when sleeping in might sound tempting,â Olsen recommends.</p> <p>Enlist friends, get a babysitter, or hire a coach ahead of time. Knowing that you have already set aside that chunk of your day to focus on your health goals is important to getting the most out of your weekend workout. If possible, aim for your big workout to fall on Saturday, and enjoy a much-deserved rest day on Sunday.</p> 6. Have a purpose or set a goal <p>A big focus of Olsenâs fitness programs is having a goal. âDecide on your destination, write it down on paper, and place it somewhere you can see it daily as a reminder of where you are going. If you donât have a destination in mind you end up wasting a lot of time,â she says.</p> <p>And time isnât something we all have. To stay focused on the bigger picture, aim for completing your first or a longer race, a new lifting max, or a smaller pants size. Reaching your goal will make all that work worth it! So worth it, youâll probably set a new fitness goal.</p> More from Health & Fitness Cheat Sheet: \n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/10-of-americas-top-rated-gyms-and-fitness-centers.html/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">10 of Americaâs Top-Rated Gyms and Fitness Centers</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/7-intense-workouts-you-can-do-in-small-spaces.html/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">7 Intense Workouts You Can Do in Small Spaces</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/5-supersets-that-get-you-in-shape-faster.html/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Get in Shape: 5 Workouts That Help You Build Muscle Faster</a></li> \n </ul></p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"a537e40d-3abc-38c5-99a7-5cd4cea88981","licensed":"true","title":"A Harvard psychologist says your success in any situation hinges on 3 things","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/harvard-psychologist-says-success-situation-153500508.html","summary":"Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy is perhaps best known as the creator of the &quot;power pose.&quot; As she...","entities":"WIKIID:Amy_Cuddy|WIKIID:Business_Insider|WIKIID:Harvard_University|WIKIID:Psychologist","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000031|YCT:001000071","publisher":"Business Insider","author":"Shana Lebowitz","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/eLrVyJi4LBxuWmw5_zATNA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE-/http://media.zenfs.com/284/2011/06/08/biz-insider-65x27_102440.gif","provider_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/","site":"finance","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"1183318087","propertyRegion":"YPROP:finance","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"1183318087","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Amy_Cuddy;Business_Insider;Harvard_University;Psychologist\" ctopid=\"1602500;1605000;1612000\" hashtag=\"1602500;1605000;1612000\" rs=\"lmsid:a0770000003N6b9AAC;revsp:businessinsider.com;lpstaid:a537e40d-3abc-38c5-99a7-5cd4cea88981\"","site":"finance","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"embedded_images":[{"source":"http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/A_Harvard_psychologist_says_your-fa54b657613436d39da2ebfbeed68207"},{"source":"http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/A_Harvard_psychologist_says_your-5d0d92f55e9c32fdca527dfa9ec4f23e"}],"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"2 hours 3 minutes ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo Finance","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000031","score":"0.84669","label":"Arts & Entertainment"},{"term":"YCT:001000071","score":"0.616162","label":"Books"}],"leadItem":true,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"KonaFilter image-container display-table float_right\"><span><span class=\"image on-image\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/_jVkSA8CawVGWVHxkB3Wcw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/A_Harvard_psychologist_says_your-fa54b657613436d39da2ebfbeed68207\" class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" alt=\"amy cuddy power posing\" data-mce-source=\"Flickr/Erik (HASH) Hersman\" data-link=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/whiteafrican/6279921332/in/photolist-ayWeDh-nQRp4m-ayWeHb-ayWePJ-ayWhSE\" width=\"640\" height=\"480.4923076923077\" /></span><span class=\"source\">(Flickr/Erik (HASH) Hersman) <br /></span><span class=\"caption\">Amy Cuddy. <br /> <br /></span></span></span></span>Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy is perhaps best known as the creator of the \"power pose.\" <p class=\"p1\">As she described in her 2012 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">TED Talk</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amy-cuddy-power-posing-boosts-your-confidence-2015-12\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">power posing</a> is about taking advantage of the body-mind connection: You adopt the body language of powerful people so that you feel and act more confident.</p> <p class=\"p1\">But power posing is just one path to a state of calm self-confidence that will help you succeed in challenging situations.

You believe your story.</h3> <p class=\"p1\">When you're present, you demonstrate conviction and passion so that other people come to believe your story, too.</p> <p class=\"p1\">In the book, Cuddy describes a yet-unpublished study she conducted, in which participants went through mock interviews. For five minutes, they had to persuade the interviewer that they were the best person for the job, while being completely honest. All the while, the interviewer held a completely neutral expression.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Three independent pairs of judges watched videos of the interviews, looking for presence, believability, and hireability. Sure enough, the interviewees who were rated more present were also rated more believable and more hireable.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Cuddy writes: \"Presence mattered to the judges because it signaled authenticity, believability, and genuineness; it told the judges that they could trust the person, that what they were observing was real.\"</p> <p><span class=\"KonaFilter image-container display-table\"><span><span class=\"image on-image\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/t.f25NzyAYfnRHQPhldlzw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/A_Harvard_psychologist_says_your-5d0d92f55e9c32fdca527dfa9ec4f23e\" class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" alt=\"confident presentation public speaking\" data-mce-source=\"Jon Gosier/Flickr\" data-link=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ww4f/5873391534/\" width=\"640\" height=\"479.5076923076923\" /></span><span class=\"source\">(Jon Gosier/Flickr) <br /></span><span class=\"caption\">\"A truly confident person does not require arrogance.\" <br /> <br /></span></span></span></span> <h3 class=\"p1\">2. You're confident without being arrogant.</h3> <p class=\"p1\">In the book, Cuddy quotes a venture capitalist describing what turns him off during an entrepreneur's pitch: \"They're too high energy and aggressive, maybe a little pushy. It seems defensive, I don't expect them to have all the answers. Actually, I don't want them to have all the answers.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">Being open to feedback is key, Cuddy told Business Insider. The more you shut down other people and their perspectives, the less appealing you become. That's because it can seem like you're trying to cover up a sense of uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"p1\">\"A truly confident person does not require arrogance, which is nothing more than a smoke screen for insecurity,\" Cuddy writes. \"A confident person can be present to others, hear their perspectives, and integrate those views in ways that create value for everyone.\"</p> <h3 class=\"p1\">3. Your verbal and nonverbal communication is in sync.</h3> <p class=\"p1\">When we're being inauthentic â or when we're intentionally deceiving someone â Cuddy said our verbal and nonverbal communication is incongruent.</p> <p class=\"p2\">In the book, she explains that's because you're constantly trying to adjust what you're saying and doing to create the impression you think others want to see.</p> <p class=\"p1\">On the other hand, when we're present, our verbal and nonverbal behavior matches. People aren't distracted trying to figure out why something feels \"off,\" and they're more likely to put their trust in you.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Ultimately, if you're confident in yourself, other people will be more likely to be confident in you, too. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amy-cuddy-explains-the-definition-of-success-in-a-job-interview-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">It doesn't necessarily mean you'll get the job</a> or the investor's money, but you'll walk away knowing that you did the best you could â and the right opportunity for you is out there.</p> <p>NOW WATCH: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/key-to-being-confident-powerful-amy-cuddy-presence-2016-1\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">A Harvard psychologist says this is key to being more confident and powerful</a></p><br /><br /><b>More From Business Insider </b><br />\n   <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amy-cuddy-how-shy-people-can-succeed-in-job-interviews-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">A Harvard psychologist shares a tip shy people can use to ace a job interview</a><br /></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amy-cuddy-being-nervous-can-make-you-more-successful-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">A Harvard psychologistÂ says thisÂ surprisingÂ traitÂ can make you more successful</a><br /></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/a-science-backed-exercise-to-reduce-your-anxiety-2015-12\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">A Harvard psychologist describes a simple exercise to reduce your anxiety in stressful situations</a><br /></li>\n   </ul></p> </p></p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"1d601af3-e523-3f99-952b-b660fe71aeb3","licensed":"true","title":"On the Fourth Anniversary of Trayvon Martin&#39;s Death, Twitter Remembers the Slain Teen","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/fourth-anniversary-trayvon-martins-death-190600593.html","summary":"Rest in power.","entities":"WIKIID:Trayvon_Martin|WIKIID:George_Zimmerman|WIKIID:Twitter","categories":"YCT:001001095|YCT:001000667|YCT:001000780","publisher":"Mic","author":"Mathew Rodriguez","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/DpvbHc..j7jjEG63GGc2Ig--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2015-11-03/ce2ef190-826c-11e5-aa20-11edc1bddb46_eaf30c75842567f61d25dd021e031144.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://mic.com/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=readMore&utm_campaign=partner","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"7645365","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"7645365","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Trayvon_Martin;George_Zimmerman;Twitter\" ctopid=\"18857489;18858989;1996000;2051500;2054000\" hashtag=\"18857489;18858989;1996000;2051500;2054000\" rs=\"lmsid:a0Vd000000Ca67WEAR;revsp:mic_26;lpstaid:1d601af3-e523-3f99-952b-b660fe71aeb3\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"22 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo - ABC News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001001095","score":"0.928571","label":"Trials"},{"term":"YCT:001000667","score":"0.924138","label":"Crime & Justice"},{"term":"YCT:001000780","score":"0.907253","label":"Society"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<div class=\"article-body-content\">\n <p class=\"\">Four years ago Friday, Trayvon Martin was killed by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida.
