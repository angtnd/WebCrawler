Professor Marc Edwards leads the Virginia Tech team. He's become a staple in Flint since last summer. Back in August, they tested about 270 homes - that's when they found the unsafe lead levels.

These are the people that are destroying our country.â</p>","<p>As for Trumpâs pledge to return to Chicago for another rally, he may want to carefully consider the venue.Â </p>","<p>âI think heâs scared,â Kimberly Aguilar, a student at Morton East High School in nearby Cicero, told Yahoo News. Aguilar and her friends, who wore t-shirts with the word âHitlerâ printed above Trumpâs face with the message âsay no to drumpfâ heard about the event and assumed thereâd be protests.Â <br /></p>","<p>âI think Chicago fights for what they believe in.

Wayne Newton, Anjelica Huston, Tina Sinatra and Joan Riversâ daughter, Melissa, evoked the Reagansâ Hollywood years; Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Caroline Kennedy and former President George W.

But there was another note they kept sounding, almost without realizing it; they kept contrasting the way she was with the way politics is conducted today. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> âUnlike too many people these days, [Nancy] didnât harden differences into definitions,â said ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer as she recalled their lunches together â lunches at which Mrs. Reagan would eat âmicroscopic amounts of foodâ and Sawyer would âhide [her] bread and butter under the tableâ so as not to âoffend.â </p>","<p> âShe knew â¦ how to stand her ground, and once it had been resolved, to move on,â said NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, as he recalled the various times he had, in fact, offended the former first lady â first by questioning whether President Reaganâs âpoor-boy narrative was overblownâ and later by forgetting to acknowledge her presence at Gerald Fordâs funeral. </p>","<p> âMost of my motherâs buddies are gone now,â added her son, Ron Reagan. âSheâs among the last of her cohort, the old gang, her generation.â </p>","<p> None of this yearâs Republican presidential candidates, itâs worth noting, were in attendance. </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img height=\"406.88\" width=\"640\" alt=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/yHwAyNYCeusgg9n0HHh0Aw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/0e402792f8927e33a8b29cc36ef3dc93/tumblr_inline_o3wgmwCxcy1t0395p_1280.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>From left, California Gov. Jerry Brown, first lady Michelle Obama, former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush leave after the funeral. (Photo: Reuters)</i><br /></p>","<p> All funerals are about loss. But Mrs. Reaganâs memorial felt like it was about more than the end of her life, or even the end of the era of elegance she embodied. It felt like the end of a political age. The services Friday threw into sharp relief how the Republican Party â the party her husband reinvigorated and redefined over more than a quarter century of leadership â is consuming itself in perhaps the most surreal presidential primary in U.S. history, which seems to be coming down to a contest pitting an opportunistic reality television star against a senator roundly despised by virtually the entire Republican caucus.</p>","<p> Trump is the most obvious apostate, his style the most obvious apostasy. Where the Reagans conveyed a kind of nostalgic glamour â she in her Adolfo suits, he in his Stetson hat, both of them writing mushy love letters back and forth â Trump, with his Chardonnay-colored comb-over, conveys only the nouveau-riche glamour of marble, gilt and his own name in oversized bronze letters. At his primary-night press conferences, Trump hawks Trump steaks, Trump wine, Trump magazine, as if campaigning to become QVC-pitchman-in-chief. He has no use for Reaganesque decorum or restraint; he slings more insults in a single speech than the Reagans did in their entire lifetimes. </p>","<p> Trumpâs politics are a departure as well. In the debates, he likes to mention that President Reagan was also a former Democrat â a fellow convert to the Republican cause. But after Reagan became a conservative in his 40s, he remained a conservative; he sounded much the same in 1984, running for reelection, as he had in 1964, delivering his pivotal âTime for Choosingâ speech. Trump has been a member of the Democratic Party, the Independence Party and the Reform Party; he has quit and rejoined the GOP twice since first registering as a Republican in 1987; his views are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Donald_Trump\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">all over the map</a>Â and <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-vs.-trump--a-look-at-donald-trumps-evolving-positions-over-the-years-482986563581\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> often the opposite of what they were a few years before</a>. </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img height=\"421.04585679806917\" width=\"640\" alt=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/j3S2gSL6uyl7ta7ChcKQhg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/5f7291932c37c762d58099936443e30c/tumblr_inline_o3wghhHndf1t0395p_1280.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p> <i>Presidential candidates Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich observe a moment of silence in memory of Nancy Reagan at the start of the Republican candidatesâ debate in Miami on Thursday. (Photo: Carlo Allegri/Reuters)</i></p>","<p>Being Republican has long meant being like Reagan â or at least saying youâre like Reagan. Republican Dinesh DâSouza neatly captured the conservative conventional wisdom when he suggested that the right âsimply need[s] to ask in every situation that arises: what would Reagan have done?â If Trump is nominated â if Republican voters select as their standard bearer someone who wants to impose trade tariffs on China, who mocks and demonizes Mexicans and who supported single-payer health care as recently as last September â it will mark the demise of Reaganism as the GOPâs primary organizing principle. Trump is about Trump. He is a party of one.</p>","<p> Ted Cruz, on the other hand, seeks to cast himself as Reaganâs heir. On the stump he promises to âreassemble that old Reagan coalition.â He often frames the GOP primary as a âtime for choosing.â And he even compares 2016 to 1980, with Barack Obama as Jimmy Carter and (you guessed it) Ted Cruz as the Gipper. </p>","<p> But what Cruz actually represents, with his tea-party purity tests and vintage 1980s-era policy positions, isnât the second coming of Saint Ronnie but rather the apotheosis of a certain strain of willful Republican misremembering. In the years since Reagan left the White House, a vocal contingent of Republicans has sought to enforce current party orthodoxy â cut taxes at all costs; limit government spending (except on defense); be guided by the Bible, as interpreted by Jerry Falwell and his acolytes â by insisting that Reagan was its source. But while these concepts often shaped Reaganâs campaign rhetoric, they didnât define how he governed once in office. As a result, the Reagan that Republicans now revere â a mythical founder figure who always cut taxes, always rattled his saber and always consulted Jesus â barely resembles the more pragmatic Reagan who actually ran the country. </p>","<p> âReagan is a difficult icon for Republicans,â biographer Lou Cannon <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/what-would-reagan-really-do-74535\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">once told this reporter</a>. âHe was an achiever and, by and large, a successful president. But he wasnât a successful president in the way that the Republican hero-worshippers describe him. Of course ideology was important to Reagan. But he was a success because of, and in spite of, ideology. He cared more about getting stuff done.â </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img height=\"424.53333333333336\" width=\"640\" alt=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/eDu7jYk0cz3N_HBxoDwe1w--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://36.media.tumblr.com/7c194f0b1929dc20adfa4dc6c0dbc1f6/tumblr_inline_o3wh5sqWet1t0395p_1280.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Ronald Reagan, with Nancy, campaigns in Miami in 1975 after announcing that he was a candidate for the presidency.

(HIV/AIDS was a prominent exception.) As Reagan speechwriter Peter Robinson once noted in the Wall Street Journal, âReagan dismissed âthe illegal alien fussââ and âagain and again declared that a basic, even radical, openness to immigration represents a defining aspect of our national identity.â When it came to taxation, there were two Reagans: the pre-1982 version, who did more than any other president to lighten Americaâs tax burden, and his post-1982 incarnation, who was willing (if not always happy) to make up gaps in the governmentâs revenue stream by raising rates. And despite his hawkish rhetoric, Reagan was a believer in arms control and only rarely resorted to military force against Americaâs enemies. </p>","<p> Worshipping Reaganâs myth, as Cruz does â and pretending that his campaign promises and rhetoric represent his entire legacy â is almost as un-Reaganesque as dismissing him entirely, as Trump does. Instead, a true Reaganite would study how the Gipper actually governed, then modernize his approach for todayâs world. </p>","<p> He would also study Nancy Reagan. </p>","<p> Most famously, Mrs. Reagan pushed her husband to update his views on guns. Even after he was shot and nearly killed by an assassin in 1981, President Reagan maintained that access to firearms was not âwhere the problem lies.â But Mrs. Reagan began to have her doubts.</p>","<p> âAfter what I saw in that hospital, Iâm not sure I agree with him,â she wrote in her 1989 memoir, âMy Turn.â </p>","<p> Eventually, President Reagan came around. âWith the right to bear arms comes a great responsibility to use caution and common sense on handgun purchases,â Reagan said in a March 1991 speech. He went on to support the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks and was named for Reaganâs press secretary, Jim Brady, who was also shot (and more seriously injured) during the assassination attempt. When critics argued that background checks were ineffective because criminals would simply cross state lines to buy guns, the former president fought back. âAll the more reason to have a federal law that fills the gaps,â he wrote in 1991. âThis level of violence must be stopped.â</p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img height=\"415.744\" width=\"640\" alt=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/QEj57TzH9vGjqOXKgo0.ag--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/b7f3c4f2bdda91a47751ed2275c93cff/tumblr_inline_o3wgpj9G2V1t0395p_1280.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, speaks at her motherâs funeral. (Photo: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)</i><br /></p>","<p>For Mrs. Reagan, this sort of pragmatism was a crucial part of her husbandâs legacy, and she carried on in his spirit after he died â even when it put her at odds with her fellow Republicans. On Friday her daughter, Patti Davis, told another, less familiar story about her motherâs insistence that a conservative could change with the times â and still be conservative.</p>","<p> âOn one occasion, I am quite certain that she was channeling my father,â Davis said. âI had gone up to her house and found her very busy making phone calls to elected officials, trying to gain their support for stem-cell legislation â something she was quite passionate about. She ended one phone call and gave me a somber look. </p>","<p> ââWell,â she said, in a calm tone, sounding much more like my father than herself. âKarl Rove is dogging my phone calls. Everyone I call, he calls right after and tries to get them to oppose stem-cell legislation.â </p>","<p> ââRight after?â I asked. âAre you sure your phone isnât bugged?â </p>","<p> ââNo, I had the Secret Service check on that.â </p>","<p> ââYou must be furious,â I told her, puzzled by the fact that she didnât seem furious at all. She shook her head no, and her entire demeanor was not only calm â it was practically Zen.â </p>","<p> Davis paused for a moment to joke that âeven people who never met my mother will know that the word âZenâ has never been applied to Nancy Reagan.â The crowd laughed. Then Davis returned to her story and recalled what her mother told her next. </p>","<p> ââThereâs no time to get upset,â she said. âThereâs work to be done. I canât get distracted. I have to keep moving forward.ââ <br /><i>â</i><br /></p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img height=\"464.74114441416896\" width=\"640\" alt=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/GE1tukVQ32YX1KoHiestFg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/492af73d86eb83715dadd5dcdb4388c9/tumblr_inline_o3wgfpJsdi1t0395p_1280.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Ron Reagan and his sister, Patti Davis, pay their respects to their mother during the funeral. <i>(Photo: Mike Blake/Reuters)</i>Â <br /></i></p>","<p><i>Cover tile photo:âJae C.

Your mileage may and likely will vary. I donât know the opponents in your league, their habits and patterns.</p>","<p>(Yeah, Iâm the guy who told you not to trust Cespedes last year, and I said it all year. I also begged you to take Arrieta and Pollock well in advance of the season. I trust that adds up to a net profit. Again, YMMV.)</p>","<p><strong>Giancarlo Stanton, Marlins:</strong> Spectacles are always going to cost a little more at the draft table. Fun picks, buzzy picks, theyâre expensive. No one questions Stantonâs awesome power, and the new arrangement in Miami (fences in, fences down) can only help â though his mammoth power would play anywhere. But given Stanton has averaged just 114 games over the last four years, wouldnât you like a little more durability with your early selection? And how many categories are we really buying here? The average could be neutral, the steals are modest and could stop at any time. I see other guys Iâd rather snag in the first round. (Take instead: Miguel Cabrera.)Â </p>","<p><strong>Freddie Freeman, Braves:</strong> Lineup protection doesnât really matter that much with respect to how often opposing pitchers offer strikes to the lone wolf in the order. But when I talk about lineup security or environment, Iâm focused on how often the batters in an order will support the player in question. Are they setting the table for him? Are they driving him in? Atlanta has been the worst offense in the majors for two years running, and I donât have much confidence in a notable improvement this year. And to make Freeman even more risky a pick, heâs coming off an injury-plagued season and his wrist isnât 100 percent yet. (Take instead, probably cheaper: Eric Hosmer.)Â </p>","<p><strong>Jhonny Peralta, Cardinals:</strong> This is the simplest concept going â when any player is faced with an extended period of rehab, Iâm always going to bet on the higher end of the return estimate. Furthermore, Iâm going to be especially grounded with expectation when that player comes back. Peralta turns 34 at the end of May and he might not be playing until the second half of the year. Listen close, thatâs the sound of me scratching Peralta off my draft board.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p><strong>Billy Hamilton, Reds:</strong> Weâve been through this one already. No pop, tons of batting average risk, difficult to trade, and heâs already nicked up to boot. His Yahoo ADP stands afloat at 106. I wouldnât even consider him until outside the Top 200. Get Delino Deshields instead, thank me later.</p>","<p><strong>Kyle Schwarber, Cubs:</strong> Another repeat. I hate pricing in improvement to a buzzy player, that means you have to elbow everyone else out of the way to land the player. No one wants to shop on Black Friday. Schwarber doesnât have a natural position and he plays for a team with too many bats, not enough slots. He didnât hit a lick against lefties last year and heâll lose some at-bats though late-inning substitutions. I get the pro angles: The Schwa has monster power and pedigree, and you love those catcher-eligibles who arenât really catchers. But the Cubs still canât use a DH in their NL schedule, which means Schwarber will be around 470-500 at-bats, not 600. And if thereâs a more public team than the 2016 Cubs, I canât see who it is. Youâll pay a vanity tax on all these guys.</p>","<p><strong><a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/7487/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Felix Hernandez, Mariners</a>:</strong> The fastball trend is headed in the wrong direction, the innings are piling up, the haul wasnât good in 2015. Maybe Felix gets it righted in 2016, but look at how deep the pitcher board is for the Top 2-3 tiers. Never talk yourself into a pricy pitcher, especially when the pickings are this lush and interesting.</p>","<p><strong><span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1457704258232\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Right\"><img title=\"Cat LatosÂ \" alt=\"Cat LatosÂ \" class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/iUW7pJDwH9gYKawvMhWhrQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MzEwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2016-03-11/78b5d430-e78f-11e5-8163-bd6fa2c0fb1f_Screen-Shot-2016-03-11-at-8-44-39-AM.png.cf.jpg\" width=\"310\" /></span></span></span><a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/8529/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Mat Latos, White Sox</a>:</strong> A little low-hanging fruit, because I donât know anyone whoâs really in on Latos.

I think it was Bill James who once said the better pitchers in baseball tended to be the smarter guys. Iâve never met Latos personally, but he doesnât strike me as the guy doing the physics homework in the Harvard hallway. Nothing against Cat Latos, we're just in it for the numbers.Â </p>","<p><strong>Yasiel Puig, Dodgers:</strong> I thought he might be a fun discount to chase after in 2016, but seeing Puigâs ADP sitting in the mid-60s, I donât think the market has corrected enough. Does Puig want to be great? Does he have the focus and dedication needed for a six-month season? Heâs hit a modest 46 home runs in 331 MLB games. On the bases, heâs 25-for-43 (the team really should red light him). Thereâs a moment in the middle of the draft where I switch to âahh screw it, letâs make upside picksâ but Puigâs ticket is still in the foundation round. I want surer things at his price range.

Are we positive Chapman will adjust smoothly to life in New York and in the American League?

I don't have a social agenda here. I have a safety agenda.\"</p> <p>When a longtime employee, a National Rifle Association-certified instructor who's been the company's unofficial security officer announced her retirement, Toland wanted to ensure the remaining employees were safe. He now requires each of them to get a concealed-carry permit, footing the $65 bill, and undergo training. He issues a Taurus revolver known as \"The Judge\" to each of them. The firearm holds five rounds, .410 shells that cast a spray of pellets like a shotgun.</p> <p>\"It is a weapon, and it is a lethal weapon,\" said Toland, whose company specializes in aviation insurance. \"When a perpetrator comes into the home or the office, they have started a fire. And this is a fire extinguisher.\"</p> <p>No employee balked at the mandate, he said. \"They all embraced it 100 percent, and they said, you know, I'm tired of being afraid,\" Toland said.</p> <p>An employer's legal standing to impose such a requirement depends on several factors, foremost whether the business is high risk, a convenience store or taxi company, for example, said Carin Burford, a labor lawyer in Birmingham, Alabama.</p> <p>More than 400 people on average are killed in the workplace each year, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Just last week, a gunman with a criminal record who had just been served with an order to stay away from his former girlfriend began a shooting spree, eventually landing at the lawn mower parts factory where he worked. Authorities say he killed three people and wounded 14 others before a police officer shot and killed him.</p> <p>About half of U.S. states have laws allowing people to keep firearms in their cars at work. There are companies that allow employees to bring firearms to the office. But it's rare to hear of an employer making it a requirement.</p> <p>Kevin Michalowski, executive editor of Concealed Carry Magazine, said he hasn't heard of any companies issuing a mandate, but he's increasingly hearing from companies, churches and schools seeking training so they're prepared to deal with a workplace shooting.</p> <p>He said while workplace shootings don't happen every day, when they do happen, people should have the ability to protect themselves â particularly before police are able to respond.</p> <p>\"The gun-free-zone sign isn't going to stop anyone. In fact, it makes people more vulnerable,\" said Michalowski, who is a part-time officer in Wisconsin for a county sheriff's department and a rural police department. \"The good people who could stop things are disarmed.\"</p> <p>One person who isn't convinced is Charles G. Ehrlich, an attorney in California. He was working for the Pettit & Martin law firm in California on July 1, 1993, when Gian Luigi Ferri, a failed entrepreneur and former client of the firm, arrived at the high-rise office building with multiple weapons, killing eight people and injuring six before killing himself.</p> <p>Ehrlich was lucky. A meeting he was attending went long, and he didn't end up down the hall in a conference room that was Ferri's first target. \"I heard the shouting and the noise\" but had just moments earlier left the floor.</p> <p>\"It's not like it is on TV or at the movies where the good guy just shoots the bad guy,\" said Ehrlich, the former president of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \"It's very difficult to shoot a gun accurately, even when you're not under pressure.\"</p> <p>Ehrlich also worries about the pressure cooker that exists in many workplaces â and that arming more employees might actually lead to more workplace shootings.</p> <p>\"Conceivably, someone who was well-trained â an ex-Green Beret or something like that â could've run down the hall, pulled out a weapon and fired a shot,\" he said of the shooting at the firm. \"But would he have prevented anyone from being killed? No. Unlike John Wayne who is always faster than the other guy, this guy got off the elevator and just started shooting.\"</p> <p>Playing in the back of Toland's mind was something personal: A beloved uncle who had adopted him as a child was killed in 1979 during a nighttime robbery at the convenience store where he worked. Three men robbed him of less than $100. It was the first day he hadn't brought a firearm to the store.</p> <p>Andrea Van Buren, an agent with Toland's firm for the past two months, was already comfortable with firearms. She carried a Glock nearly every day for the past decade and practices at a range every week.</p> <p>When she hears about workplace shootings elsewhere, among her first thoughts is: \"I'm glad it's not happening here and then the second part is, it could happen here, and then I think, at least I'm prepared,\" she said. \"It's sad. It's heartbreaking.\"</p> <p>The revolver Toland is providing his employees isn't exactly ideal for concealment. It weighs two pounds and is more than 9 inches long. By contrast, a Beretta Nano 9mm handgun is more than a third lighter and measures less than 6 inches. Van Buren said she's not bothered by the impracticality. \"I liken it to, I have an office computer and I have an office gun.\"</p> <p>She understands that not everyone wants to work for a company that requires having a weapon. \"Gun ownership isn't for everybody.

said Friday, as military tensions surge on the Korean peninsula with South Korean and US forces engaged in large-scale joint exercises condemned by Pyongyang.</p>","<p>Since the joint drills began Monday, the North has issued daily warnings and statements, talking up its nuclear strike capabilities and threatening to turn Seoul and Washington into \"flames and ashes.\"</p>","<p>Just days after he was photographed posing in front of what state media described as a miniaturised nuclear warhead, Kim said the weapon required further testing.</p>","<p>Overseeing a ballistic missile launch on Thursday, Kim ordered \"more nuclear explosion tests to estimate the destructive power of the newly produced nuclear warheads,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said.</p>","<p>Experts are divided as to just how far the North may have gone in shrinking warheads to a size capable of fitting on a ballistic missile -- a major step forward in strike capability that would present a heightened threat to South Korea, other countries in the region and, eventually, the US mainland.</p>","<p>- Nuclear strike drill -</p>","<p>According to KCNA, Thursday's launch of two short-range ballistic missiles, which traversed the eastern part of the country before falling into the East Sea (Sea of Japan), was part of a nuclear strike exercise.</p>","<p>The aim was to simulate conditions for \"exploding nuclear warheads from the preset altitude above targets in the ports under enemy control,\" the agency said.</p>","<p>Watching the exercise, Kim reiterated an earlier threat to launch an immediate nuclear attack if the \"sabre-rattling\" South Korea-US drills should harm \"even a single tree or a blade of grass\" on North Korean territory.</p>","<p>\"I will issue a prompt order to launch attack with all military strike means,\" he said.</p>","<p>Military tensions on the divided Korean peninsula have been on the rise since the North carried out its fourth nuclear test in January, followed by a long-range rocket launch last month.</p>","<p>South Korea and the United States responded by scaling up their annual joint drills, which Pyongyang has always condemned as provocative rehearsals for invasion.</p>","<p>- 'Decapitation' strike -</p>","<p>The North's anger has been fuelled this year by reports that the drills included a \"decapitation strike\" scenario in which the North Korean leadership and command structure is taken out at the start of any conflict.</p>","<p>In light of such drills, \"our self-defensive countermeasures should adopt a more preemptive and offensive mode,\" Kim said.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>The UN Security Council responded to the North's latest nuclear test and rocket launch by adopting tough, new sanctions, which Pyongyang condemned as a \"gangster-like\" provocation orchestrated by the United States.</p>","<p>Reacting to Kim's call for more nuclear tests, South Korea on Friday said the North Korean leader was being \"rash\" and displaying his ignorance of international opinion.</p>","<p>\"The international community is imposing strong and comprehensive sanctions and this only goes to prove why they are necessary,\" said Unification Ministry Spokesperson Jeong Joon-Hee.</p>","<p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday voiced grave concern over the growing tensions, and urged North Korea to avoid any further \"destabilising acts.\"</p>","<p>Kim, however, chose to highlight the need for a diversified nuclear strike force, capable of delivering warheads from the ground, air, sea and underwater.</p>","<p>The North has conducted a number of what is says were successful tests of a submarine launched ballistic missile.</p>","<p>Outside experts have questioned the results of those tests, suggesting Pyongyang had gone little further than a \"pop-up\" test from a submerged platform.</p>"]},"property":"news","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s
