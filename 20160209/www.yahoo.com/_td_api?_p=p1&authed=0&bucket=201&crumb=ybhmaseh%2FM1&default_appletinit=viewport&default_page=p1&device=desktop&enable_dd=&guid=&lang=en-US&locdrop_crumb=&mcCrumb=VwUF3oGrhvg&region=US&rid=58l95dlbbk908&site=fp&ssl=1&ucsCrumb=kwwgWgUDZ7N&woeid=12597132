Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said in a statement late Wednesday the NAACP were taking issue with the grand jury secrecy only because the group disagreed with the decision not to charge the officers involved in the November 2014 shooting.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xBu_039HBd4AWZju4rUfow--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://l.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/151028/rice.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"640","height":"360"}},{"followId":"7a639110-8249-11e5-9e18-fa163e2c24a6","name":"Keystone pipeline","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"false","id":"ffd0ccfe-98eb-3719-8d3f-d9e5b2a451e9","cluster_id":"7a639110-8249-11e5-9e18-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"TransCanada sues U.S. over Keystone XL pipeline rejection","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/transcanada-sues-u-over-keystone-xl-pipeline-rejection-000708491--finance.html","image_assets":[{"width":"450","height":"293","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I4Azod7YqeSCfCF.rpZkQA--/aD0yOTM7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--2139936553.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZXsk.eJr4N5fOk17YdaWwg--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--2139936553.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kxAaq4MW4HVfQ.oh13yQOg--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--2139936553.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-01-07T02:34:37Z","summary":"By Nia Williams and Valerie Volcovici CALGARY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp sued the U.S government on Wednesday to reverse President Barack Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, and also plans to seek $15 billion in damages from a trade tribunal.

And I want to get things done. #ImWithHerâ under a picture of Hillary Clinton. <br /></p>","<p> But in remarks at a Clinton rally here Monday, former Pres. Bill Clinton owned his background as a Southern centrist and took pains to remind his wifeâs supporters that not all of America looks like progressive New England. </p>","<p> âIt bothers me to be in an election where debate is impossible because if you disagree youâre just part of the establishment,â Clinton said. It was a reference to<i> </i>Hillary Clintonâs Democratic presidential primary opponent Bernie Sanders, who has cast himself as a fighter against âthe political establishment.â </p>","<p> He cited a list of politicians who back Hillary Clinton â including New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, both of whom appeared at the rally and spoke on her behalf â as people he doesnât consider âestablishment politicians.â </p>","<p> A number of Arkansans were also in the audience, and Clinton singled one man from his home state out: âOur immediate past senator Mark Pryor, who was defeated in a landslide in 2014 in large measure because he voted for a healthcare bill. </p>","<p> âThat doesnât strike me as establishment,â Clinton continued. âAnd nobody alive in my state thinks he lost because people thought he wasnât liberal enough.â </p>","<p> Pryor was defeated by Tom Cotton, a tea party-backed candidate, who beat him by nearly 20 points after Pryor ran an ad defending President Obamaâs health insurance overhaul. </p>","<p><b><i><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/battle-hampshire-180002262.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Slideshow: The battle for New Hampshire >>></a></i></b></p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> âSheâs the best change-maker Iâve ever known,â Bill Clinton said about his wife, adding, in a nod to her ability to get things through Congress, ââ¦ Just about everything she did had Republican support.â </p>","<p> When it came to health care reform,<i> </i>the Clinton administration failed in 1993 because âwe just didnât have 60 votes in the Senate,â the former president said. </p>","<p> âThere hasnât been a single change in the health care in 60 years plus, since Harry Truman tried to get universal health care, that hasnât had 60 votes in the Senate to break the Republican filibuster,â Clinton continued. But the S-CHIP program backed by Hillary Clinton won with the support of Republicans, he said. The smaller, bipartisan approach to legislating made progress, with GOP support, where the big Clinton bill failed. </p>","<p> âWe canât get in a place where weâre so mad that we demonize anybody whoâs against us, where we canât have any honest discussion about whoâs got a better health care reform [plan], where everybody thatâs on the other side is part of some mythical establishment, including people like Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign fund,â Bill Clinton said. âWe canât do that.â </p>","<p> Hillary Clintonâs speech that followed ranged over a wide array of topics but also argued strongly against Sandersâ proposed single-payer health coverage plan. </p>","<p> âWe got a bipartisan coalition in the House and the Senate and we passed it,â Clinton said of S-CHIP. âIt wasnât everything we wanted, but I often think of that old saying, you know, a person who refuses a half a loaf because itâs not a whole loaf has never gone hungry.â </p>","<p> She said that the goal now had to be to build on the Affordable Care Act and defend it against Republican efforts to repeal it. </p>","<p> âWhat we cannot do is start over. We cannot take what looks good on paper, an idea and say, you know what, weâre going to thrust our nation into a contentious debate and start all over. Itâs a lot easier to get from 90 percent coverage to 100, than it is to get from zero to 100.â </p>","<p> Republicans currently hold majorities in both the House and Senate. They also are defending more seats than Democrats in the 2016 Senate races, but if the Democrats canât flip five seats to retake the Senate, an incoming Democratic president would take office with little congressional support than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama enjoyed in their first two years. Both had a Democratic House and Senate to work with in their early years. The House is considered safe for the Republicans in anything short of a Democratic landslide<i>. </i> </p>","<p> Sanders says he would mobilize Americans for a political revolution to pressure a Republican Congress to pass his progressive agenda. Clinton, by contrast, Â  Â  promises to find common ground with Republicans on areas such as infrastructure investment that would, she said, act as a âjobs program.â </p>","<p><i>(Cover tile photo:Â Brian Snyder/Reuters)</i></p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/yahoo-politics/hampshire-primary-turns-100-years-002417606.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>"]},"property":"politics","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"e54c7986-0e2c-3785-b677-57218bdefbee","licensed":"true","title":"Live coverage: All-day, all-night New Hampshire primary updates","link":"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/live-coverage-all-day-all-night-new-hampshire-194829115.html","summary":"The first-in-the-nation primary (not a caucus!) takes place Tuesday, February 9, in the Granite State.

Villanova got 11 first-place votes in the USA Today Top 25, but so did the Terrapins, who are No. 2 in both polls. After going a long time without big victories, Marylandâs rÃ©sumÃ© is getting stronger by the week: competitive road losses to North Carolina, Michigan and Michigan State donât hurt; there are quality wins in recent weeks over Iowa and Purdue; and earlier road/neutral victories over UConn and Wisconsin are gaining currency.

Current spot in the Pac-12 standings: First, at 9-2, with a 1 Â½-game lead over USC. Ducksâ last Pac-12 title: 2002. Oregon figured to have graduate transfer Dylan Ennis starting at point guard, but he suffered a foot injury after playing just two games. Jumping into a primary ball-handling role has been 6-7 sophomore Dillon Brooks, who leads the team in scoring and assists and might be the Pac-12 Player of the Year at this point. Ducks still have four road games left, trips to the Bay Area and Los Angeles, but theyâve been on a dominant run the last three weeks.</p>","<p><strong>Louisville (7)</strong>. Last ACC title: never. The Cardinals slid out of a first-place tie Monday night in a hard-fought loss at Duke, but at 8-3 remain right in the race. The problem is a remaining schedule that includes five more games against teams in the Pomeroy top 40, three of them on the road. However, if any ACC team should have maximum motivation down the regular-season stretch, itâs the one that isnât going anywhere when said stretch is over.</p>","<p>Iowa. Last Big Ten title: 1979. If the Hawkeyes can get a victory at Indiana on Thursday, theyâll have a good shot at winning the conference. The remaining schedule after visiting Bloomington: Minnesota, Wisconsin and Indiana at home; Penn State, Ohio State and Michigan away. If the Hawkeyes falter, the league might be won by second-place Maryland. The Terrapinsâ last Big Ten title: never.</p>","<p><strong>West Virginia (8)</strong>. Last Big 12 title: never. The Mountaineers had a great week, beating Iowa State in Ames and Baylor in Morgantown to take the lead in the league. But the rest of the schedule is rough: at Kansas Tuesday, at Texas the following Tuesday, home against Oklahoma and Iowa State, at Baylor March 5. The league could still end up back in Kansasâ control â as usual â when all is said and done.</p>","<p><strong>LSU (9)</strong>. Last SEC title: 2009. There was justifiable lamentation about the Tigersâ 7-5 start to the season, but an 8-2 conference mark has at least pushed them into the bubble discussion and into the lead in the uninspiring SEC. Plenty of lose-able games remain, though, starting Wednesday at South Carolina and then home Saturday against <strong>Texas A&M (10)</strong> â which, if LSU stumbles, could win its first-ever SEC title.</p>","<p><strong>WHO CAN CARRY A TEAM IN MARCH?</strong></p>","<p>Sometimes, one red-hot player can take a team a long way in tournament play. The Minutes lists a few explosive, dominant types to keep an eye on:</p>","<p><strong>Buddy Hield (11)</strong>, Oklahoma. If you saw the Buddy Show Monday night, you know: he cannot be stopped. Hieldâs 3-pointer with 1.3 seconds left beat a valiant and improving Texas team in Norman, the exclamation point on a 27-point night â 21 of those coming in the second half. He is the current king of clutch, the sultan of streak shooting, the most relentless worker on the offensive end â and the nationâs leading scorer on top of it all. If Kruger can keep him fresh enough for tournament time, he could take Oklahoma to Houston. At least.</p>","<span style=\"\" class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n <div class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\" style=\"left: 0px; background: #cccccc;\" id=\"ymh-player-iframe\">\n  <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><div class=\"js-video-placeholder RatioBox Bgc-x Bd-0\" data-yepConfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;page_space_id&quot;:&quot;2146234107&quot;,&quot;video_uuid&quot;:&quot;10ddf17b-17b4-3fe2-8c22-32f4057471a6&quot;,&quot;device&quot;:&quot;desktop&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;sports&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{&quot;showTitle&quot;:true,&quot;showDescription&quot;:true,&quot;showButton&quot;:true,&quot;showProvider&quot;:false},&quot;width&quot;:640}\"></div></div>\n </div></span>","<p><strong>Denzel Valentine (12)</strong>, Michigan State. The Spartans are riding Valentine for everything heâs worth â and heâs worth a lot. Namely, 18.6 points per game, 7.9 rebounds and 6.7 assists. Even with some occasional big shooting nights from sidekick Bryn Forbes, the Michigan State offense revolves around Valentine. In non-blowouts in Big Ten play, heâs averaging 38 minutes. In terms of all-around facilitation of the offense, even Hield has as much on his shoulders as Valentine does.</p>","<p><strong>Jamal Murray (13)</strong>, Kentucky. Heâs a volume shooter with a ton of confidence and plenty of green light from John Calipari, who needs his backcourt to carry a team that is light on frontcourt production. When Murray is rolling, he can score with anyone â like last Saturday, when he torched Florida for 35 points. He also dropped 33 on Ohio State in a losing cause earlier in the season, going off after halftime. He can get carried away, take bad shots and force the action â against Louisville he was 3-of-14 with seven turnovers â but heâs also capable of winning an NCAA game or two by himself if the shots are falling.</p>","<p><strong>Fred VanVleet (14)</strong> and <strong>Ron Baker (15)</strong>, Wichita State. Theyâre the most veteran backcourt in college basketball: Van Vleet has played in 127 games, Baker 109 â 18 of them in postseason tournament action. They were key parts of the Shockersâ Final Four run in 2013, the undefeated regular season in â14, and the Sweet 16 team of a year ago. Now theyâre combining for 27 points, eight rebounds and nine assists for a Wichita State team that could make another March run. Good luck trying to eliminate these guys.</p>","<p><strong>Grayson Allen (16)</strong>, Duke. Moved way up in the Irritating Dukie Hierarchy Monday night by deliberately tripping Louisvilleâs Raymond Spalding and being called for a flagrant foul. Allen plays with a chip on the shoulder, but heâs more than talented enough to back it up. He is leading the Blue Devils in scoring (20.9 ppg) and assists (3.7), with the skill to kill from the 3-point line and the athleticism to fracture defenses on the drive. Right now, Duke will have to play its way out of a mediocre NCAA seed â but Allen just might be able to lead them deep in the tournament anyway.<span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1455029081055\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Right\"><img title=\"Will Ben Simmons and LSU make the NCAA tournament?

The question is not whether the likely 2016 No. 1 pick could take over â itâs whether he would. Or would he defer and watch? Or would coach Johnny Jones fail to force the game to come to Simmons? One concerning stat: Simmons is taking a lower percentage of LSUâs shots vs. âTier A and Bâ opponents, to use Pomeroyâs methodology, than teammates Craig Victor and Tim Quarterman â neither of whom are projected lottery picks. That needs to change.</p>","<p><strong>RUNNING THE CONFERENCE TABLE</strong></p>","<p>Only four teams still have a chance of winning their conference title undefeated. The Minutes looks at who they are, and appraises their chances.</p>","<p><strong>Stony Brook (18)</strong>. The record: 11-0 in the America East. After dispatching Hartford Monday, next up is Maryland-Baltimore County (6-19, 2-8). But after that it gets difficult, with three of the Seawolvesâ closing four games against teams with winning records â New Hampshire, Vermont and Albany on the road Feb. 17. Minutes projection: 15-1.</p>","<p><strong>Yale (19)</strong>. The record: 6-0 in the Ivy League. Over the course of five games, forward Brandon Sherrod did something remarkable â he made an NCAA-record 30 straight field-goal attempts, spanning from Jan. 16 to Feb. 5. Eventually he had to miss, and did. And eventually Yale will have to lose. The next four games are on the road, including a visit to primary Ivy rival Princeton. Minutes projection: 11-3.</p>","<p><strong>San Diego State (20)</strong>. The record: 11-0 in the Mountain West. The Aztecs have a great record but plenty of close calls â theyâve won six MWC games by three points or less or in overtime. That includes last weekâs narrow escapes at home over Colorado State and New Mexico â the latter steeped in controversy. The leagueâs best defensive team is offensively challenged, and that means there will be blood on the record. Minutes projection: 16-2.</p>","<p><strong>Stephen F. Austin (21)</strong>. The record: 10-0 in the Southland Conference. Guard Thomas Walkup took his already-good game up another level last week, averaging 32.5 points and 11 rebounds in two more victories for the Lumberjacks. Theyâve already aced their toughest road game â a five-point win at Texas A&M-Corpus Christi â and may not be challenged again until a Feb. 29 visit to Incarnate Word. Closing with three straight on the road is tough, but The Minutes thinks SFA will prevail. Minutes projection: 18-0.</p>","<p><strong>TWO TICKETS TO DAYTON HAVE BEEN PUNCHED ... FOR SOMEONE</strong></p>","<p>Due to NCAA rules issues, two sure-fire tournament teams are out â one by NCAA decree, the other by its own hand. <strong>SMU (22)</strong> was nuked before the season started, and Louisville sidelined itself Friday in a move nobody saw coming. Now the question is, which two teams will benefit from their absence by squeaking into the field of 68? The Minutes has two early nominees:</p>","<p><strong>Syracuse (23)</strong>. Would be thematically consistent, since the Orange were kept out of last yearâs tourney due to NCAA violations. Syracuse has played itself back into contention for a bid after an 0-4 ACC start and a horrid non-conference loss to St. Johnâs. It is now 6-5 in the league, with wins at Duke and over Notre Dame. âCuse can help its cause much more by holding serve the rest of the way at the Carrier Dome and winning at least one of three road games at Louisville, North Carolina and Florida State.</p>","<p><strong>Seton Hall (24)</strong>. Louisvilleâs self-imposed ban might be a boon for one of Rick Pitinoâs former assistants, Kevin Willard, whose dad, Ralph, is on the current Louisville staff. (In his sixth year at Seton Hall and still looking for an NCAA bid, the younger Willard could use any and all breaks.) The Pirates have played themselves into the conversation in recent weeks, beating Providence and Creighton on the road and Georgetown at home â and they have a non-conference ace in the hole from beating Wichita State in December. Going 4-3 the rest of the way would put Seton Hall in good position going into the Big East tournament.</p>","<p><strong>READER POLL</strong></p>","<p>The Minutes wants to know: which has been the better off-court, in-game entertainment this season?</p>","<p><strong>Monmouth bench mob (25)</strong>. Wonderfully fun element of a very good (19-5) team. The highlight moment was<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87jdHDNOs-0\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> re-enacting Michelangeloâs masterpiece Sistine Chapel painting</a> during one early-season game. This team needs to be in the NCAA tournament.</p>","<p><strong>Arizona State Curtain of Distraction starring Michael Phelps (26)</strong>. ASUâs free-throw tomfoolery has become a cult-classic element of Pac-12 ball, but the school added true star power last month when it got Olympic GOAT Michael Phelps to guest star behind the curtain. When his Speedo cameo resulted in two missed Oregon State free throws, the stunt quickly became the stuff of legend.</p>","<span style=\"\" class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n <div class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\" style=\"left: 0px; background: #cccccc;\" id=\"ymh-player-iframe\">\n  <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><div class=\"js-video-placeholder RatioBox Bgc-x Bd-0\" data-yepConfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;page_space_id&quot;:&quot;2146234107&quot;,&quot;video_uuid&quot;:&quot;9167edc8-b5e3-32ee-a83a-9ff6fcd2d6af&quot;,&quot;device&quot;:&quot;desktop&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;sports&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{&quot;showTitle&quot;:true,&quot;showDescription&quot;:true,&quot;showButton&quot;:true,&quot;showProvider&quot;:false},&quot;width&quot;:640}\"></div></div>\n </div></span>","<p>Tweet The Minutes your choice at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yahooforde\" target=\"_self\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">@yahooforde</a>, or send an email: <a href=\"mailto:fordesports@yahoo.com\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">fordesports@yahoo.com</a>.

BOBBY HURLEY</strong></p>","<p>The Minutes caught up with Arizona State Sun Devils coach and former NBA player and Duke star <strong>Bobby Hurley (27)</strong> last month. After an overachieving start with a modestly talented roster, Pac-12 play has been a challenge â the Devils are 13-11 overall, 3-8 in the league, in Hurleyâs first year after he had success at Buffalo. Some outtakes from a conversation with one of the most decorated college players of the past 25 years:</p>","<p>Q: What was the appeal to take this job?</p>","<p>A: I know itâs a great league and I thought my style of coaching would fit into a league like this. I look at myself as someone who likes to develop players and to be an innovator in some ways on offense, and this has always been an offensive league. And my background as a blue-collar player, defensively, would carry over here as well.</p>","<p>Q: Athletic director <strong>Ray Anderson (28)</strong> is all-in on basketball?</p>","<p>A: Heâs very invested. We were both in agreement that we think it could be special here. Weâve got a lot of work to do here, but he is committed to it.</p>","<p>Q: You took a little longer to get into the family business (Hurleyâs dad, Bob, is a legendary high school coach in New Jersey and younger brother Danny is in his sixth year as a college head coach). Was there a part of you that didnât want to coach?</p>","<p>A: I wanted to be around my kids a lot, and to raise my kids and see them grow up and be a big part of their lives. I know the investment we make to coach, the amount of time we put into it. And then it was like waiting for the right opportunity. Every time the tournament came around, I felt empty â I wanted to be a part of that. I always thought, âIs this going to be the year?â And it never developed. Then my brother had a really good opportunity for me as an assistant and I wanted to be with someone that I trust.</p>","<p>Q: How are you like your dad and brother as a coach, and how are you different?<span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1455029081057\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Right\"><img title=\"Bobby Hurley and the Sun Devils are currently sitting in 11th place in the Pac-12.

Iâll fight for my team, and then on the practice court we ask our players to work hard and we demand that. Weâre going to call guys out and have accountability, but we do it in a way thatâs constructive for our players and they like playing for us. Iâm not as vocally demanding in some ways as my dad.</p>","<p>Q: Yeah, I didnât hear you yell once at practice.</p>","<p>A: I will. You didnât hear me earlier this week, when we were coming off a three-game losing streak. The closer we get to a game, you want to try and build guys up more and get them ready to play. The one thing I did learn from <strong>Mike Krzyzewski (29)</strong> more than anything was the way he was able to reach his players. Guys loved playing for him. There was a trust there.</p>","<p>Q: Have you picked Kâs brain since youâve been coaching?</p>","<p>A: Heâs helped me throughout. My brother is my main source â weâre on the phone every day. Iâve asked Coach some things â like last year, leading into our conference tournament, how does he prepare guys for that? Because it didnât work our first year at Buffalo, we lost our first game, and you donât get second chances at that level. (Buffalo won the MAC tournament last year.)</p>","<p>Q: How much were you involved with basketball during those years between playing and coaching?</p>","<p>A: I was involved â I coached my sonâs PAL team when he was 5, so Iâve been at all levels (laughs). The biggest thing at that level is the snack. You have to get the right snack to have them perform at a high level.</p>","<p>Q: How does the family (Hurley is married with three children) like being out West?</p>","<p>A: My wife loves it. My oldest daughter is going to Duke, sheâs a sophomore, and my middle daughter was planning on going to Duke, but now it looks like sheâs going to stay home and go to ASU. She really likes the area. We all do. And my son, heâs here at practice a lot. He sits on the bench.</p>","<p>Q: Does he have the Hurley fire?</p>","<p>A: I donât know if I can push all the buttons you need to push. My dad had to go to some deep places with me to push myself the way I did. Some of it will have to depend on him â when I see how much he wants it, that will tell me how hard to push. But he loves the game, and he knows it.</p>","<p><strong>CONFERENCE ASSESSMENT: THE PAC-12</strong></p>","<p>Likely NCAA tournament teams: There could be as many as seven from the league, which would be a Pac-12 record.

The improvement in both has been remarkable â especially the Trojans, who havenât had a winning league record or made the NCAAs since 2011.</p>","<p><strong>Utah (33)</strong>, <strong>Colorado (34)</strong> and <strong>California (35)</strong> are on the bubble. The Utes and Buffaloes are 17-7 overall, 6-5 in the league. The Golden Bears are 15-8, 5-5. For all three, fortunes tend to rise and fall depending on whether the week calls for two games at home or two on the road. Their NCAA status likely will go down to the wire.</p>","<p>Speaking of home/road mood swings: Oregon State is now 12-3 in Pac-12 play at home in two seasons under Wayne Tinkle, 1-12 on the road.</p>","<p>UCLA, which has played its way out of the tournament at the moment, has a huge weekend in Arizona. The Bruins need at least one win, and really could use two to get back into the bubble mix.</p>","<p>Possible Top 16 seeds: Oregon and Arizona. But neither is assured at this point.</p>","<p>Coaches who need to have some urgency: Almost nobody, since the conference has undergone major turnover in the last couple of years. Lorenzo Romar has been the source of speculation for years, but if the Huskies make the tournament for the first time since 2011, that should keep him employed in Seattle â unless heâs looking to jump. The other long-tenured coach without a lot to show for it is Stanfordâs Johnny Dawkins, whose team has struggled to an 11-10, 4-6 record. But Dawkinsâ run to the Sweet 16 in 2014 and NIT title last year should provide him the latitude for a down year with a young team.</p>","<p><strong>UNDER-THE-RADAR LOVE</strong></p>","<p><strong>Pascal Siakam (36)</strong>, New Mexico State. The 6-foot-9, 230-pound sophomore forward from Cameroon is dominating the Western Athletic Conference, averaging 22.2 points, 12 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game. Siakam has racked up 21 double-doubles on the season, highlighted by a Herculean 24 points, 23 rebounds and five blocks against rival UTEP on Dec. 2. (NMSU also beat the Miners Dec. 19, sweeping the annual home-and-home border series for the second time in the last three years.) Primarily a paint banger, Siakam even stepped outside and made his second career 3-pointer Saturday in a victory over Utah Valley that improved the Aggies to 17-8 overall, 8-1 in the WAC.</p>","<p><strong>COACH WHO EARNED HIS COMP CAR</strong><span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1455029081059\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Right\"><img title=\"Bob Huggins' Mountaineers have won their last two games against Iowa State and Baylor.

Huggins is still coaching fearless, combative defense and still getting players to compete like their hair is on fire. Itâs a beautiful thing, even if Huggs isnât. (At least his sideline attire and scowl arenât.)</p>","<p><strong>COACH WHO NEEDS TO TAKE THE BUS TO WORK</strong></p>","<p><strong>Scott Drew (38)</strong>, Baylor. Drew loves his zone defenses of varying shapes, which is fine if your team can play them. But the Bears have been getting scorched from the perimeter for the past six games. Opponents in that stretch have made 48 of 102 3-point shots â and while itâs one thing to be scorched by the marksmen from Oklahoma (16 of 28), itâs something altogether different when Kansas State (a 29-percent team from beyond the arc) hits half its attempts against you. Baylor has lost half of those games, including two in a row, to fall into a tie for fifth place in the Big 12.</p>","<p><strong>BUZZER BEATER</strong></p>","<p>In honor of Villanovaâs ascension to No. 1 in the rankings, The Minutes suggests a visit to Philadelphiaâs <strong>Pub and Kitchen (39)</strong>, in Center City.

Follow these 13 rules and you should be able to surf in safety.</p>","<h2>Rule #1: Update early and often</h2>","<p>If thereâs a vulnerability in your operating system, browser, or other software, be assured the bad guys know about it. But no matter how quickly software makers plug that hole and push out an update, it wonât do a damn bit of good if you donât actually install it. So install updates as soon as theyâre available, especially those marked âcritical.â Better yet, set your OS and apps to automatically update if possible. Yes, itâs a hassle to update Java and Adobe Acrobat every flipping week, and some updates <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/tech/surprise-apple-latest-ios-release-breaks-key-feature-172312391.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">may occasionally break things</a>. Do it anyway.</p>","<h2>Rule #2: Honor thy antivirus software and keep it current</h2>","<p>Installing antivirus software isnât the safety net it used to be, thanks to the increase in âzero dayâ threats that appear before AV companies can update their software. But theyâll still stop more than 90 percent of the threats youâre likely to encounter. So get some. If youâre unwilling to pony up $30 to $60 a year for <a href=\"http://www.bitdefender.com/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">BitDefender</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mcafee.com/us/index.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Intelâs McAfee</a>, you can download perfectly adequate solutions from <a href=\"http://free.avg.com/us-en/free-antivirus-download\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">AVG</a> or <a href=\"https://www.avast.com/en-us/mac\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Avast</a> for free. Â </p>","<h2>Rule #3: Donât fall for that scam</h2>","<p>You know whatâs an even bigger threat than malware authors and cybercrooks? You. The easiest way for an attacker to get access to your logins is to fool you into giving them up. This is usually achieved via a âphishingâ email that looks like itâs from your bank, employer, or the IRS; this email aims to lure you to a bogus site where you enter your login name and password. Once the attackers have your info, they can log into your account, then steal your information and sell it to others.

Opening the document usually infects your computer. If you donât recognize the sender, just delete the email. If the message appears to come from a friend or colleague, make triple sure that person actually sent it to you before you open it.</p>","<h2>Rule #5: Become a cyber-savvy parent</h2>","<p>Sexting, cyberbullies, and catfishing â being a parent of an Internet-age kid isnât easy.

One is for the network â thatâs the one you type when you log on from a new device. The other password is for the router; this allows you to go in and change network settings (like your Wi-Fi password). Most people remember to change the first set of logins but not the second, and the router defaults are widely known (usually âadminâ and âpasswordâ).

The agency found more than 100 crashes and over a dozen injuries, mostly in Jeep Grand Cherokees.</p>","<p>Agency tests found that operating the center console shift lever âis not intuitive and provides poor tactile and visual feedback to the driver, increasing the potential for unintended gear selection,â investigators wrote in the documents. They upgraded the probe to an engineering analysis, which is a step closer to a recall. NHTSA will continue to gather information and seek a recall if necessary, a spokesman said.</p>","<p>The investigation could determine just how much automakers can change the way cars operate when they introduce new technology, and how far they can stray from conventional ways of controlling vehicles that drivers are accustomed to.</p>","<p>Jake Fisher, director of auto testing for Consumer Reports, expects more problems and investigations as automakers continue to roll out new electronic controls that are unfamiliar to drivers. âI think the manufacturers need to be much more responsible as they try these new technologies,â he said.</p>","<p>The governmentâs probe now covers more than 856,000 vehicles including the popular Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV from the 2014 and 2015 model years and the 2012 through 2014 Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans with 3.6-liter V6 engines.</p>","<p>In the vehicles, drivers pull the shift lever forward or backward to select gears and the shifter doesnât move along a track like in most cars. A light shows which gear is selected, but to get from Drive to Park, drivers must push the lever forward three times. The gearshift does not have notches that match up with the gear you want to shift into, and it moves back to a centered position after the driver picks a gear.</p>","<p>The vehicles sound a chime and issue a dashboard warning if the driverâs door is opened while they are not in Park. But investigators found that the push-button start-stop feature doesnât shut off the engine if the vehicles arenât in Park, increasing the risk of the vehicles rolling away after drivers have exited.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>âThis function does not protect drivers who intentionally leave the engine running or drivers who do not recognize that the engine continues to run after an attempted shut-off,â investigators wrote.</p>","<p>Thus far, the investigation has found 314 complaints, 121 crashes and 30 injuries from the problem. Three drivers reported fractured pelvic bones, while four others needed to be hospitalized with a ruptured bladder, fractured kneecap, or severe leg trauma.</p>","<p>Fiat Chrysler says it is cooperating in the probe. The company changed the shifters in the 2016 Grand Cherokee and 2015 Charger and 300 sedans so they function more like people are used to. But FCA said it did so to increase customer satisfaction and not for safety concerns.</p>","<p>One driver, in Atkinson, New Hampshire, complained that in November of last year, her 2014 Grand Cherokee began traveling in reverse with no driver inside. The SUV crossed a street, crashed into a mailbox and rolled up a driveway. The driver wrote that she tried to get back into the Jeep but was knocked to the ground and it rolled over her legs and injured her. The Jeep eventually stopped after hitting a fence. Drivers are not identified in the NHTSA complaint database.</p>","<p>âThe shift knob is a real problem,â wrote another driver from Enumclaw, Washington, who reported two unintentional roll-away incidents in a 2015 Grand Cherokee. âI am not a complainer, however this is a major safety issue. It terrifies me to drive this vehicle.â</p>","<p>Fiat Chrysler is not alone with the tricky shifters. Fisher says BMW and Mercedes-Benz have similar gearshifts. He said the government has a thin line to walk between stifling innovation and keeping people safe.</p>","<p>âI think the best thing for consumers isnât that legislation comes,â he said. âThe best thing is that automakers really do not start adding features that are really confusing to people and cause accidents.â</p>","<p>____</p>","<p>Follow Tom Krisher at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tkrisher\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">https://twitter.com/tkrisher</a> .
