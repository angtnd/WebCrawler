(Try it yourself.) </p>","<p> Itâs an agonizing thing for them to contemplate, but in conversations with a half dozen of the leading Republican strategists and lobbyists this week, it became clear that a solid consensus is forming as to which guy they would rather see get the keys. When it comes to Trump versus Cruz at the top of the ticket, most in the so-called establishment would prefer the devil they know to the daredevil they donât. </p>","<p> For the moment, of course, Trump looks very hard to stop. And if youâve been paying attention to his debates and election night speeches lately, you may have noticed that â in between recitations of every poll heâs ever read, and the rambling monologues on genitalia and civil jurisprudence, and the brandishing of his <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-displays-steak-water-wine-defend-business-record-084751244--finance.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">personal steaks</a> and his own print magazine (who knew?) â heâs been consciously trying to reach some kind of rapprochement with party insiders. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> On Tuesday night, for instance, after winning in Michigan and Mississippi, Trump used the opening minutes of his victory speech/news conference/traveling revue to call for party unity.

And theyâre profoundly troubled by an authoritarian streak â on issues like immigration and the militaryâs <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-torture-terrorist-families-international-law-waterboarding-2016-3\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">treatment of civilians</a> â that would seem to make George W. Bush look like a lawyer for the ACLU. </p>","<p> Vin Weber, the congressman turned superlobbyist, does a pretty tidy job of encapsulating these concerns. âI donât think heâs a âbig Râ Republican, and I donât think heâs a âsmall Dâ democrat,â Weber told me, âand both of those are big problems for me.â </p>","<p> Most of the partyâs governing class, of course, is still hoping for a kind of triple bank-shot gambit to stop Trumpâs march toward the nomination. The latest plan goes like this: </p>","<p> Somehow hope that <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/rubio-is-not-a-republican-obama-and-thats-his-161955503.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Marco Rubio</a> â who received exactly zero delegates from the four contests earlier this week â can stage a comeback win in Florida Tuesday, while <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/john-kasich-keeps-it-real-maybe-too-real-the-124591847086.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">John Kasich</a> manages to eke out a win in Ohio (where heâs the governor, by the way). Then keep Trump from amassing the 1,237 delegates needed to lock up the nomination before the convention, by which time Republican leaders will have settled on a preferred candidate (probably Kasich) whom they can try to ram through. </p>","<p> Which isnât a terrible plan, except that itâs a little like me saying I have a brilliant plan to become a billionaire, and all I have to do is start by coming up with some kind of amazing app that everyone in America wants to buy. Hope is not a strategy. </p>","<p> The more likely scenario for denying Trump the nomination, at this point, is that Cruz can overtake him, or that he ends up mounting a serious convention challenge if Trump canât lock up the delegates before then. And while the D.C. elites are none too jazzed about this possibility, theyâre starting to almost embrace it. </p>","<p> The reason Republicans in Washington donât like Cruz is that even by the standards of Washington, where we think of blatant self-promotion the way most other Americans think about getting out of bed in the morning, he seems to stand out for his insincerity. Colleagues disdain the holier-than-the-rest-of-you image he has cultivated since arriving in the Senate just three years ago. </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/Nekg_teRBQFFMCT6C4dPaQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://38.media.tumblr.com/36942d5a21b1c2ec64fd2159953489f2/tumblr_inline_o3tuqpFlCj1tdop5d_540.gif\" height=\"195\" width=\"540\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p> But that same opportunism, they will tell you, is what ultimately makes Cruz a more palatable nominee. Thatâs because they assume that Cruzâs evangelical and anti-government purity is more a matter of political positioning than it is of actual zealotry. </p>","<p> If nothing else, the insiders believe, Cruz is coachable and calculating in a way Trump is not, and heâs a more reliable conservative. </p>","<p> With Cruz as the nominee, Republicans figure they have at least an outside shot at holding the Senate, mainly by giving their more vulnerable candidates some distance from him. Less so with Trump, whose insatiable need for controversy and incendiary appeals to emotion might overwhelm everything else. </p>","<p> None of which is to say that Cruz has a better chance of winning than Trump. He doesnât, and even most governing Republicans will admit that Trump could conceivably broaden the appeal of the party nationally, while Cruz almost certainly runs its aground. Heâd have a better chance of landing his own show on MSNBC than he would of winning the popular vote â something Republicans have done only once in the last 20 years. </p>","<p> But that might not be the worst thing in the world, either. If Cruz were to become the nominee and suffer a Goldwater-type thrashing in November (which probably canât happen, given the polarized electoral math of the country today, but he could certainly do worse than John McCain or Mitt Romney), then governing Republicans might finally be able to go on the offensive against their own activists. </p>","<p> The argument then would go something like this: âHey, we tried it your way, and we nominated a purist, and we got dismantled, and now the Clintons are prying up floorboards in the Lincoln Bedroom and retrieving all the secret files they once squirreled away.

The choices suggest the White House plans to challenge the Republican Senate to block a nominee whose pedigree might have paved the way for a relatively easy confirmation, if the fight weren't playing out in an election year.</p>","<p>Obama's top tier of candidates include Judge Sri Srinivasan of U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Merrick Garland, chief judge on same court, and Judge Paul Watford of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to a source familiar with the selection process. Ketanji Brown Jackson, a D.C. district court judge, is also under consideration, although a less likely option, said the source, who was not authorized to publicly discuss private White House deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>","<p>The judges' inclusion on the short list was first reported by National Public Radio, which also named Judge Jane Kelly of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals as a finalist being interviewed by the president.</p>","<p>The president's advisers planned to meet Thursday at the White House with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss filling the vacancy.</p>","<p>The emerging list, which the White House says is not final, seems in line both with Obama's personal and political aims. As he has in his past two nominations, Obama appears drawn to candidates with traditional resumes â Supreme Court clerkships, prestigious posts in government and stints at major law firms.</p>","<p>The list also shows the president grappling with whether to add racial or gender diversity to the court. Srinivasan, 49, would be the first Indian-American on the court, while Watford, 48, would be the third African-American to hold a seat. Brown Jackson, 45, would be the first African-American woman.</p>","<p>But the push to make history appears to be just part of an especially complex mix of calculations. Facing Republicans vowing to block any nominee and preparing to mount a months-long campaign to back up their position, the White House has repeatedly stressed that the nominee will have \"impeccable\" credentials â suggesting the choice will have a record so sterling it will shame GOP senators into backing down.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Obama's consideration of Garland appears to fit into that approach. Garland, a white 63-year-old with an Ivy-League, East-Coast background, would not add diversity to the court. But with a reputation as a judicial moderate and with broad respect in Washington, Garland could put maximum pressure on some GOP senators to crack from leadership opposition.</p>","<p>Others on the list press different political buttons. Both Srinivasan and Watford come with some bipartisan endorsement. Srinivasan was unanimously confirmed to the bench in 2013. Watford's confirmation vote was a more partisan 61-34 split.</p>","<p>As Obama appointments, neither comes with long records on the bench, leaving their judicial philosophies somewhat ambiguous.</p>","<p>Other candidates come with added challenges and will test Obama's interest in adding diversity of experience to the court.</p>","<p>The president appears to have ruled out naming a politician or administration official, despite briefly considering Attorney General Loretta Lynch. On the short list, only Kelly, a former public defender in Iowa, did not follow the traditional ladder to the highest court.</p>","<p>The risks associated with her experience have already emerged. In recent days, conservative groups raised questions about Kelly's work securing a plea deal for a man facing child pornography charges. After two decades as a criminal defense lawyer, there's little doubt there are more cases like that in her background.</p>","<p>Even in a normal confirmation environment, there will be many types of arguments available to opponents, said Michael Gottlieb, a former White House lawyer who is now a partner at the Washington firm of Boies, Schiller and Flexner. The White House tries to limit those to leave the nominee's opponents with \"only the most unattractive arguments,\" he said, adding: \"All it takes to form the basis of a narrative against a nominee is one negative story.\"</p>"]},"property":"news","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":908,"width":640,"ratio":142,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/uezDEjkm19M8.tGP0oQLrQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0xO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/4cb262188308b70c920f6a706700c6d7.jpg","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/u3.dqe_sMlgZ.iQdUGYWCQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/4cb262188308b70c920f6a706700c6d7.jpg","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"b91bb20b-9086-343f-b7f1-bc8569eef60f","licensed":"true","title":"Police Hunt Underway After Madeleine McCannÂ âSpottedâ In Paraguay","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/police-hunt-underway-after-madeleine-141218610.html","summary":"A massive police operation, including officers from Interpol, is underway after it was claimed that missing British youngster Madeleine McCann has been âspottedâ in Paraguay.

Typically they coalesce behind the candidate most closely linked with the party establishment, but in the case that an outsider prevails overwhelmingly, they will traditionally respect popular will (as was the case with Obama in 2008).

Your kindness, your compassion, your willingness to help a stranger in need have stayed with me until this day. And no matter how many times my mind takes me back to that horrible life-altering moment, it is not all darkness. Because you reached out to help, you offered a ray of light in the bleakest moment Iâve ever endured. You may not remember it. You may not remember me. But I will never, ever forget you.
