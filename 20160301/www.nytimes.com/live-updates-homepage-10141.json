Democrats offer an alternative, a chance to cast presidential primary ballots in person \u2014 or by email, post or fax.\n \nVoting in a bar, somehow, got people to mingle. That was just fine for Hallie Engel, 34, who grew up in Alaska and voted for Mr. Sanders.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice to know that you can go out and meet like-minded people,\u201d she said.\n \nKirk Troy, 46, who is from Richardson, Tex., and researches Chinese companies for a living, likes the concept of drinking and voting. He cast his ballot for Ms. Clinton then bought a glass of Hoppy Lager for just under $10.\n \n\u201cI think this needs to be enshrined in the Constitution,\u201d he said.\n  \nHong Kong wasn\u2019t even the first place to vote on Tuesday. That honor belonged to Americans in Wellington, New Zealand, who gathered after midnight \u2013 in true Dixville Notch, N.H., style \u2013 to be the first voters in the world to vote on Super Tuesday, said Alex Montgomery, a spokesman for Democrats Abroad, who was registering people to vote at the bar.
