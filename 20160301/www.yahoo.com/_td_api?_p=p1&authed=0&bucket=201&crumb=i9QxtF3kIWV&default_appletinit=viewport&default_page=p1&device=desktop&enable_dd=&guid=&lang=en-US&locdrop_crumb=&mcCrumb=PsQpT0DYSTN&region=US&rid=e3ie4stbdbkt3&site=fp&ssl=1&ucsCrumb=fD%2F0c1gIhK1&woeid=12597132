McQuaid explained why the newspaper was endorsing the New Jersey governor for president.</p>","<p>âGov. Christie is right for these dangerous times,âÂ <a href=\"http://www.unionleader.com/For-our-safety,-our-future:-Chris-Christie-for-President\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">McQuaid wrote in a Nov. 28 editorial</a>. âHe has prosecuted terrorists and dealt admirably with major disasters. But the one reason he may be best-suited to lead during these times is because he tells it like it is and isnât shy about it. Other candidates have gained public and media attention by speaking bluntly. But itâs important when you are telling it like it is to actually know what you are talking about.â</p>","<p>Christie finished a distant sixth in the New Hampshire Republican primary and suspended his campaign. That didnât bother McQuaid. But Christieâs surprise endorsement of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump did.</p>","<p>âBoy, were we wrong,âÂ <a href=\"http://www.unionleader.com/An-Editorial-Joseph-W-McQuaid-Publisher-Christie-was-our-bad-choice\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">McQuaid wrote in a follow-up editorial that was published Tuesday</a>. âWatching Christie kiss the Donaldâs ring this weekend â and make excuses for the man Christie himself had said was unfit for the presidency â demonstrated how wrong we were. Rather than standing up to the bully, Christie bent his knee. In doing so, he rejected the very principles of his campaign that attracted our support.â</p>","<p>McQuaid continued: âVoters here apparently knew better than we. Most rejected Christie but divided their votes among several others, leaving Trump to claim victory. And now, despite specifically telling us that he would never endorse him, Christie is backing Trump. If nothing else, that might wake up some Trump fans. We will look for that, just as soon as we get the egg off our face.â</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>The stinging editorial extends a streak of humiliating turns for Christie.</p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://news.yahoo.com/video/christie-disagrees-trumps-policies-even-133321644.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>","<p>On Saturday, after Christie introduced Trump at a campaign rally at an airport in Arkansas, the billionaire mogul could be heard on a hot mic telling the New Jersey governor to âgo home,â pointing to a plane waiting for him on the tarmac.</p>","<p>On Sunday, Hewlett-Packard chief executive Meg Whitman, who served as the national finance co-chairman for Christieâs failed presidential campaign, called his endorsement of Trump <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/meg-whitman-christie-trump-astonishing-political-174053492.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">âan astonishing display of political opportunism</a>.â</p>","<p>âDonald Trump is unfit to be president,â Whitman said in a statement. âHe is a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears.

The Jayhawks scored the game's first 15 points, opened a 24-point edge by halftime and led by as many as 33 in the second half en route to a lopsided victory.</p>","<p>Kansas had already clinched at least a share of its 12th straight Big 12 title on Saturday, but the Jayhawks now have claimed first place outright. They're two games clear of second place West Virginia in the loss column and three or more clear of everyone else.</p>","<p>With 12 RPI top 50 victories and only one loss to an opponent outside the top 50, Kansas also has a firm grip on the NCAA tournament's overall No. 1 seed. The Jayhawks (25-4, 14-3) could lose their regular season finale this weekend against Iowa State, fall in the opening round of the Big 12 tournament and still comfortably claim a No. 1 seed on Selection Sunday.</p>","<p>That Kansas came out with such fire anyway on Monday night suggests the Jayhawks aren't satisfied with what they've accomplished so far. They shot 64 percent from the field against a previously surging Texas team coming off an upset of Oklahoma.</p>","<p>Ellis was a matchup nightmare for Texas' slow-footed frontcourt. The Kansas senior scored 20 points on 9-for-11 shooting, torching the Longhorns in the post, via jump shots and off the dribble.Â </p>","<p>When Ellis wasn't hurting Texas, it was Kansas' array of shooters. Frank Mason, Devonte Graham and Wayne Selden each hit multiple threes as the Jayhawks sank 10 of their first 13 attempts from behind the arc.</p>","<p>While the blowout loss on senior night was disappointing for Texas, the bigger concern moving forward is the health of dynamic lead guard Isaiah Taylor.

While most of the tranche of files bagged and seized by U.S. Navy SEALs who killed in 2011 him have not yet been cleared for public release, officials said most of the massive archive from hard drives and hard copies curiously are dated after 2009. </p>","<p> The newly declassified files, which were <a href=\"http://www.dni.gov/index.php/carousel-items/1330-newly-declassified-documents-for-bin-laden-s-bookshelf\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">published online by the government</a> later this morning, include directions to an al-Shabab leader in Somalia to attack French targets if American targets are not available, and what appears to be bin Laden's opinion that al Qaeda should execute French hostages right before a national election to affect the political outcome. </p>","<p> \"If [French President Nicolas Sarkozy] continues to refuse to negotiate, then one week before the French presidential elections we will kill one of the men (hostages), the one with the lowest rank and position in the company,\" the letter says. At some point the plan appears to have changed as four French hostages, presumably the ones to whom the letter refers, were released by al Qaeda's north African affiliate AQIM in 2013, two years after bin Ladenâs death. </p>","<p> The subject of the Iranian regime, which has held some al Qaeda figures under house arrest while allowing other officials in the Sunni terror group to operate more freely since 2001, was raised often in al Qaeda's internal discussions and mentioned in 28 of the 113 documents reviewed by ABC News Monday. </p>","<p><span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1456849470810\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Left\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/oUxAIpVtsr1HraS3.7iMSg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NDAwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/gma/2016-03-01/03251d60-dfca-11e5-b8f9-6773ea47d88c_ht_odni_binladen_will_lf_160301.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></span></span> A 2007 letter by Bin Laden told his lieutenants that \"pressure should be applied gradually\" on the Iranian regime to release his family members and key al Qaeda leaders such as Abu Hafs al-Masri, a top figure who eventually was purportedly freed last fall from house arrest in Iran. </span></p>","<p> \"When you can, please let me know the reasons why the brothers coming from Iran were detained, God release them. I stress that anyone coming from there should take the necessary security precautions,\" Bin Laden wrote. </p>","<p> A 2011 message released by the U.S. intelligence community in a batch last May from bin Laden to his wife Khairah asked her about dental work she received while under house arrest in Iran, appearing paranoid in his questioning about possible micro bugging or tracking devices being installed unknowingly in her teeth using a syringe. Bin Laden repeatedly stated he wanted her to join him but he worried she could be tailed. </p>","<p> Several newly declassified letters appear to include follow-up correspondence with his wife, in which he explains to her that he and his men \"horribly fear the filling you were given,\" because computer chips used to track people can be planted \"under the skin.\" </p>","<p> \"I ask you to report to me in detail anything you find suspicious from any doctor in Iran, like if the syringe is the usual volume and its head has a slightly larger diameter than normal,\" bin Laden wrote in the January 2011 letter. </p>","<p> Another dated only three months before SEAL Team Six operators shot the al Qaeda leader Abbottabad continued to ask his wife about her medical procedures, suggesting she get an x-ray or ultrasound to see if any tracking devices had been placed inside her body. He apologized for quizzing her, begging her to \"please excuse me if I have worn you out with some of these details.\" </p>","<p> In other letters, the mujahid-turned-hermit appears whiny, pleading with his loyalists to help all of his family members \"under house arrest\" in Iran. </p>","<p> \"We asked several times that they be let go so that they could go to Pakistan. Tehran did not respond to that, so maybe you could attempt to work on releasing them to the Waziristan area of Pakistan, where we can make sure they are all right there with these tribes,\" bin Laden wrote in an undated letter. </p>","<br>","<br>","<p> Among the few documents pre-dating 2009 recovered from the house was Bin Laden's handwritten last will and testament. The 1990s-era will said he had \"about $29 million\" in the Sudan remaining of his personal wealth, presumably inheritance from his wealthy father's Saudi construction firm. Bin Laden lived in the Sudan and funded well-publicized road projects in the country until 1996, when he relocated back to Jalalabad, Afghanistan, now under Taliban rule. </p>","<p> He envisioned carving up his then-fortune â which was later likely confiscated by Sudanese authorities after his return to Afghanistan -- among his family members and giving $1 million each to two loyal lieutenants, Abu Hafs al-Mauritani and Abu Ibrahim al-Iraqi Saad Jarwar. </p>","<p> \"The bulk of it was to go into the pot ...for jihad,\" explained a senior intelligence official, who spent years studying the cache of al Qaeda documents. </p>","<p> Bin Laden himself explained that he had \"received twelve million dollars from my brother Abu Bakir Muhammad Bin (Laden) on behalf of Bin Laden Company for Investment in Sudan. I hope, for my brothers, sisters, and maternal aunts, to obey my will and to spend all the money that I have left in Sudan on Jihad, for the sake of Allah.\" </p>","<p> After 9/11, his siblings went to great pains to distance themselves from their infamous brother Osama, with some even changing the English spelling of their English surname to \"Binladin.\" </p>","<p> The al Qaeda leader also singled out two of his many children for payments in the event of his death, including his heir apparent Saad Bin Laden. But Saad met his maker before his father did, perishing in a CIA drone strike inside Pakistan in 2009 after being released by Iranian officials from house arrest there. </p>","<p> The documents also reveal that as far back as the mid-2000s there were fears from some in al Qaeda that some in the groupâs Iraq franchise were attempting to split from the âcoreâ organization based in Pakistan. Years later, those concerns would prove prescient as al Qaeda-Iraq (AQI) evolved into ISIS and <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/WN/fullpage/isis-trail-terror-isis-threat-us-25053190\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">publicly turned on its parent group</a>. </p>","<p> <em>ABC News' Lee Ferran contributed to this report.

Dan Flynn (R), one of the architects of the Texas anti-abortion law that the justices will rule on.</p>","<p>And Bee showed that Flynn doesn't know the basic facts about how an abortion is performed.</p>","<p>Flynn co-authored HB2, the omnibus anti-abortion bill that has closed about half of Texas's abortion clinics. If it's upheld, it will close even more clinics, and possibly inspire other states to get bolder with their anti-abortion lawmaking.</p>","<p>Bee started off by confronting Flynn about how his bill has forced abortion clinics to close:</p>","<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Dan Flynn</strong>:<strong> </strong>This was to be sure that we provided health care, safe health care for women.</p> \n <p><strong>Samantha Bee</strong>: How does removing access to health care increase access to health care?</p> \n <p><strong>DF</strong>:<strong> </strong>We're not removing access to health care. We're improving it.</p> \n <p><strong>SB</strong>:<strong> </strong>So the intention of the law was not to do away with abortions.</p> \n <p><strong>DF</strong>:<strong> </strong>No.</p> \n <p><strong>SB</strong>: It was just to make them impossible to acquire.</p> \n <p><strong>DF</strong>:<strong> </strong>You know better than that.</p> \n <p><strong>SB</strong>:<strong> </strong><i>Do</i> I?</p> \n <p><strong>DF</strong>:<strong> </strong>What do you mean impossible? I'll tell you what, anytime you start cutting on people's body you need to have it in a procedure where it can be healthy.</p> \n <p><strong>SB</strong>:<strong> </strong>Of course. You don't <em>cut </em>a woman during an abortion, though.</p> \n</blockquote>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Then Bee cut away to the infamous \"Red Wedding\" scene from <em>Game of Thrones </em>and said (spoiler alert): \"To be fair, Flynn grew up in ancient Westeros, where they did abortions the old-fashioned way.\"</p>","<p>Westeros aside, Bee is right. Despite being called a \"surgical abortion,\" most abortions don't actually require any surgery or cutting. Everything happens through the cervix, which is slightly dilated so a vacuum aspiration tube can pass through. A first-trimester abortion is an outpatient procedure that takes five to 10 minutes and is usually performed with mild sedation or local anesthesia.</p>","<p>\"I'm not a doctor, I don't know,\" Flynn said after that. \"But I listened to many doctors tell me about the procedures that happen when you do an invasive surgery.\"</p>","<p>\"You don't seem to know anything specifically about abortion, really at all,\" Bee countered. \"And yet you did all this with building regulations.\"</p>","<p>As Bee pointed out, Flynn wasn't exactly the brainchild of HB2 even though he co-authored it. That credit goes to Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion lobbying group that prewrites model legislation for abortion opponents in state legislatures to use. Their efforts have helped launch a massive wave of anti-abortion lawmaking in the past five years.</p>","<figure> \n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" alt=\"One-quarter of all restrictions passed in last five years\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/1oF7zKMpXSNvgGiJ8hS5FQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/vox.com/66fd1475ceea1e71f8b65689afc7f132\"></span> <cite>Guttmacher Institute</cite> </img>\n</figure>","<p>If Flynn doesn't understand how abortion works, though, he's not alone.

Wade Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion in 1973.</p>","<p>The 2013 Texas law at the heart of the case imposes restrictions on abortion clinics so rigorous that activists say they could force 75 percent of the facilities to go out of business.</p>","<p>That would leave just 10 abortion clinics in the sprawling state with an estimated 5.4 million women of child-bearing age.</p>","<p>As a result, hundreds of thousands of women are having or will have to seek abortion services far from their homes, and face a weeks-long wait.</p>","<p>Under the law, doctors who perform abortions must have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and the clinics must meet the standards of an ambulatory surgical center, a medical facility for low-risk surgeries.</p>","<p>Backers of the law say it aims to protect women's health.</p>","<p>But critics say that's a pretext for a thinly veiled Republican attempt to have Roe v Wade overturned.</p>","<p>- Out of reach, expensive -</p>","<p>\"I am highly skeptical of the claims that these measures are intended to safeguard women's health,\" said Sherry Colb of Cornell Law School. </p>","<p>\"They operate as stumbling blocks in the path of clinics that had already been providing safe (and legal) abortions.\"</p>","<p>The strategy of drastically reducing the number of available clinics would make travel \"prohibitive\" and \"may pose an insurmountable obstacle for many women who are seeking to terminate their pregnancies,\" Colb added.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>In a recent study, the Texas Policy Evaluation Project found that the law has triggered long waits, surcharges and sometimes prevented women from ready access to a clinic.</p>","<p>\"This case is so important nationwide because some of the opponents of the right to abortion have enacted and are trying to enact similar laws in other states,\" said attorney Michael Dell, who represents women who had abortions.</p>","<p>He warned that more clinics will close and abortion opponents will impose more restrictions and burdens on abortion providers if the Texas law is upheld.</p>","<p>Last week, a court backed a similar law in Louisiana that is threatening to close three of the state's four abortion clinics.</p>","<p>- 'Not ready to be a mom' -</p>","<p>More than 110 female lawyers and other women in the legal profession filed supporting briefs largely aimed at Kennedy in which they described how their abortions allowed them to plan for their subsequent professional and family lives.</p>","<p>\"To the world, I am an attorney who had an abortion, and, to myself, I am an attorney because I had an abortion,\" read an email from one of the women listed in the filing.</p>","<p>In all, dozens of so-called amicus briefs have been filed in support of both sides of the issue.</p>","<p>In a video from the Center for Reproductive Rights, actress Amy Brenneman recalls her personal experience with abortion.</p>","<p>\"I was wise enough to know I'm not ready to be a mom,\" she says.</p>","<p>\"I look back at my 21-year-old self... and I feel so blessed that I was in a place where I wasn't shamed and I was supported, and it didn't scar me for life.\"</p>","<p>From 2011 to 2014, US states adopted no fewer than 231 new abortion restrictions, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p>","<p>And the number of states considered hostile to abortion rights -- with at least four types of abortion restrictions -- more than doubled from 13 in 2000 to 27 in 2014.</p>"]},"property":"news","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s

Not to mention how host Chris Rock will approach the âOscars So Whiteâ controversy, and who he will target during the opening monologue. \n Did Leo finally take home a golden statue? Whose speech was the funniest? Most touching? Controversial? Just how adorable wasÂ nine-year-old Jacob Tremblay? And what moments had everyone talking? \n Related : Who won and who lost at the 2016 Academy Awards \n The buzz began during the red carpet events prior to the official event. Jennifer Jason Leigh, nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for The Hateful Eight , seemed slightly out of it during her interview with Ryan Seacrest on E!âs special. But arguably the biggest surprise was Best Actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio ( The Revenant ) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role nominee Kate Winslet ( Steve Jobs ) playing to their nostalgic fans by walking the red carpet together. Can you believe it&#8217;s been nearly two decades since they starred together in the 1997 blockbuster filmÂ  Titanic Â (which took home Best Picture)? Letâs all let out a collective âAww.â \n Chris Rockâs Opening Monologue \n Right out of the gate, host Chris Rock addressed the elephant in the room: the controversy over the lack of diversity in this yearâs nominations. \n &#8220;Welcome to the Oscars. Or as some people like to call it, the &#8216;white peopleâs choice awards,&#39;&#8221; the comedian joked. &#8220;If hosts were nominated, I wouldnât be here; instead, youâd have Neil Patrick Harris.&#8221; \n Rock, who addressed the issues with ease and expected humor, added that he did seriously consider quitting after so many people spoke out and pressured him to do so. âBut the last thing I need is to lose another job to Kevin Hart,â he said, as the crowd erupted in laughterÂ (including Hart himself, who was in the audience). \n Arguably, the best part of Rockâs monologue was his blatant dig at Jada Pinkett-Smith and her vocal âboycottâ of the Oscars. âIsn&#8217;t she on a TV show? Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihannaâs panties,â he said. âI wasnât invited!â Ouch. \n On a more serious note, Rock suggested that with this being the 88 th annual Academy Awards, the absence of any black nominations has had to have happened already at least 71 other times, including duringÂ the 1950s. âPeople didnât protest back then,â he said, âbecause we had real things to protest at the time.â Double ouch. \n The entire monologue, in fact, was focused on addressing the issue: Rock said this yearâs In Memoriam segment would just cover black people shot by the cops on their way to the movies. He suggested that Hollywood wasn&#8217;t racist in the way we know it, but rather &#8220;sorority racist.&#8221; And, of course, there was his reference to Sylvester Stalloneâs movie Creed as âBlack Rocky,â which takes place in a fictional world where white athletes are as good as black ones. \n While Rock hit it out of park in addressing the #oscarssowhite issues, it would have been nice if he made at least a portion of the monologue about the actual movies. That said, hopefully thereâs more humor to come beyond the topic of race throughout the broadcast. Stay tuned. \n Best Moments \n The spoof video about how itâs tough for black actors to get good roles \n Rock&#8217;s focus on black actors continued. And leave it to the funnyman toÂ inject this focusÂ into Oscar-nominated films in the most hilarious and, in one case, creepiest ways. It started with Whoopi Goldberg mopping the floors in a scene from Joy , where she mocks Jennifer Lawrenceâs character for not being able to speak on camera about her new mop. Of course a white girl gets an entire movie made about her because she invented a mop, she says. A black person would have to invent a cure for cancer! \n We also see Saturday Night Live âs Leslie Jones in place of the bear that attacks Leonarodo DiCaprio in The Revenant , presumably after he failed to call her back after a date. In another clip, Rock himself plays the title role in theÂ  The Martian , while Jeff Daniels and Kristen Wiig contemplate whether to spend the $2,500 âwhite dollarsâ it would require to retrieve the black astronaut from outer space. But the real treat was Tracy Morgan in a dress wearing red lipstick and eating a pastry in his version of The Danish Girl . Welcome back, Tracy! \n Rock calling Sam Smith George Michael \n Blink and you might have missed it, but after Sam Smith performed his Oscar-nominated tuneÂ  Writingâs on the Wall from the latest James Bond movie Spectre , Rock pointed his way and applauded the musician, noting that Father Figure is his favorite song. That tune was, of course, written by another notable openly homosexual Brit, George Michael. Guess Rock figures he&#8217;d even the playing field on the stereotyping front? But Smith got the last laugh; when he later picked up his Oscar for the song, he dedicated it to the LGBT community. \n Tina Fey pretends sheâs drunk \n While presenting the award for Production Design alongside Steve Carell, who appears in Best Picture nominated flick The Big Short , Tina Fey tried to pretend she was inebriated. Production design can take us to unusual places, the pair told us, as Fey offered up the example of âthat place where a bear lives.â She continued to purposely slur her words. Cute. \n Jared Leto collectively gets the world to Google the word âmerkinâ \n While introducing the award for Hairstyling alongside Margot Robbie, Oscar winner Jared Leto undoubtedly caused a collective &#8220;Google&#8221; for the word âmerkinâ as he referenced the, er, unique âhairstyleâ type as being one that was occasionally required during filming. Do you know what a merkin is? If not, get ready for a hearty laugh once you look it up &#8212; #merkin. \n The real Suge Knight \n Rock highlighted several people in attendance on whom roles were based, including the real Michael Rezendes from the movie Spotlight (he was played by Oscar nominee Mark Ruffalo)Â and the real Joy Mangano from Joy ( played in the movie by Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence). Then, he cut to the âreal Suge Knightâ from Straight Outta Compton , showing a bald black man strapped to a gurney in an orange jumpsuit, flanked by two cops. Way to help the cause, Rock! \n âWould like to thankâ ticker \n What a clever way to ensure that award recipients can thank everyone theyâd like to, but also get on and off the stage quickly while avoiding the dreaded hurry-up music. As award recipients walked up on stage, a ticker (presumably when provided) appeared at the bottom of the screen, with a scrolling list of who theyâd like to thank. Okay, so it&#8217;s a bit informal, but at least winners don&#8217;t need to worry about forgetting anyone! \n Black history month honoring Jack Black \n Angela Bassett appeared in a short clip from the Academy to honor Black History Month, highlighting that great âblackâ actor, Jack Black. All right, Academy Awards. We get it. Youâre poking fun at yourself. Clever. \n C3PO and R2-D2 make a quick appearance \n The dynamic Star Wars duo of C-3PO and R2-D2 appear on stage, alongside BB-8, the droid from the new movie, for a quick bit of comic relief. After scolding his pal for forgetting the envelope, C-3PO looks over at a big photo of the golden Oscar statue and remarks that it looks like him (itâs certainly not the other way around). It was nice and all, but can this movie win an award, already? \n Please, buy some Girl ScoutÂ cookies \n Rock urges the audience to buy some Girl ScoutÂ cookies from his daughters, since heâs been away and missed the selling season and the opportunity for them to beat out that friend that always sells the most. Everyone from Kate Winslet to Lou Gossett Jr. was happy to fork over a few bucks for a box of thin mints to help out. After all, these stars are probably starving as they wait for the dinner portion to start! And hey, talk about some fantastic free advertising for the Girl Scouts. By the way, it&#8217;s clear Rock&#8217;s daughters won this year: he revealed later in the broadcast that over $65,000 worth of cookies were sold. \n Kevin Hart gives a heartfelt speech? \n Who would have thought that Kevin Hart of all people would be the one to speak most eloquently about diversity issues. When appearing on stage briefly to introduce The Weeknd, who performed his Oscar-nominated song Earned It from Fifty Shades of Grey , the comedian urged his fellow black actors not to focus on tonight and these awards. Rather, focus on doing what we love, working hard, and doing it well. Couldnât have said it better. \n Interview of passers-by outside a theater in Compton \n Taking a tip from late night TV hosts, Rock showed a segment whereby he interviewed passers-by in front of a movie theater in Compton about the diversity controversy. The best part: one woman who believes heâs making up the names of the actual nominated movies. Rock revisited the diversity issue far too much, and probably did so on purpose. Why quit the job, after all, when you can simply make the entire three-hour broadcast about the diversity issues? \n Twitter games \n Rock attempted to start his own Oscar game by Tweeting in the middle of the broadcast and asking that viewers take a shot every time he makes the audience feel uncomfortable. Awk-ward. \n Chris Rock insults Asians? \n In attempt to spread the lack of diversity &#8220;love,&#8221; Rock brought out three Asian children, presumably representing PricewaterhouseCoopers. If the joke offended you, he says, just Tweet about it on your phones that were made by these three kids as well. Clearly, nothing was off limits. \n Dave Grohl singsÂ the In Memoriam segment \n Foo Fighters frontmanÂ Dave Grohl&#8217;s performance of the Beatles&#8217;Â  Blackbird live on stage to celebrate those we lost this year, was truly beautiful. MentionsÂ included Wes Craven, Robert Loggia, Maureen OâHara, Omar Sharif, Alan Rickman, David Bowie, Leonard Nimoy, and more. \n Joe Biden asks college kids to take a pledge against sexual abuse \n In a passionate speech, Vice President Joe Biden asks everyone to take the pledge that they will intervene if they see someone in a position where they are not giving consent, or may not be able to give consent, to prevent them from becoming a victim of sexual abuse. It was a fitting introduction to Lady Gagaâs powerful and moving performance of âTil It Happens to You from The Hunting Ground. \n Sacha Baron Cohen presents as Ali \n Sacha Baron Cohen presented an award as one of his many hilarious alter egos, Ali G. âI know what you are all thinking,â he says in the characterâs signature street accent. âAnother token black presenter.â Following a few racially-charged jokes, he adds that heâs presenting in honor of all of those who have been overlooked, including black character from Star Wars: Darth Vader. Ah, how we miss Ali G. \n Leonardo DiCaprio gets a standing ovation \n After six nominations and zero wins, itâs no surprise that Leonardo DiCaprio received a standing ovation following his big win for Best Actor for The Revenant . He used the platform to discuss his environmental concerns about climate change and the threats it poses. Good on him for using his win not to promote himself, but an important cause. âLet us not take this planet for granted,â he ended. âI do not take tonightÂ for granted.â \n \n \n Also watch: Sidd Srinivasa on Where Home Robots Will Be in Five Years \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Please enable Javascript to watch this video","id":"29da4cdf-1a09-3ba0-81e7-15a1d229fe94","title":"Here are the most buzzworthy moments from the 2016 Oscars","type":"photo","shortCaption":"The 88th annual Academy Awards are underway, andÂ viewers are anxiously awaiting the ceremony to find out if their favoriteÂ flicks and actors win, which categoriesÂ will seeÂ big âupsets,â and which speeches and performances will stand out.

I thought about quitting Ã¢â¬Â¦ but I realized they are going to have the Oscars anyway Ã¢â¬Â¦ the last thing I need is to lose another job to Kevin Hart,\" said Rock. <br /><br />â¢ <em>Check out PEOPLE's <a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/package/0,,20985752,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">full Academy Awards 2016 coverage</a> and <a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20985752_20990445,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">complete winners list</a>!</em><br /><br />He also questioned why this awards ceremony was subject to such scrutiny out of the Academy's long history. <br /><br />\"It's the 88th Academy Awards, which means this whole 'no black nominees thing' has happened at least 71 other times,\" said Rock. <br /><br />Rock went on to mock the #OscarsSoWhite protest, saying African Americans did not protest the Oscars in the '50s and '60s because they had \"real things to protest at the time.\" <br /><br /> <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Pj6sUj3A4HprmJwHXveSsQ--/aD00ODA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/86dd0aa60ead8589d876fbf6af55d9b1\" alt=\"Chris Rock Hits #OscarsSoWhite Boycotts and Racism in Hollywood in Explosive Opening Monologue| Academy Awards, Oscars 2016\" border=\"0\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span> \"Jada [Pinkett Smith] boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited,\" he continued, before noting that while it was unfair that Will Smith was not nominated for <em>Concussion</em>, \"it's also not fair that Will was paid $20 million for <em>Wild Wild West</em>.\" <br /><br />Rock also answered a question he said on everyone's mind: \"Is the Academy racist?\" <br /><br />\"Is it burning cross racist? No ... It's a different type of racist,\" Rock said, concluding \"Hollywood is sorority racist. 'We like you Rhonda, but you're not a Kappa.' \" <br /><br />Rock said Hollywood's African American community simply wants equal opportunities. <br /><br />\"We want black actors to get the same opportunities. That's it. Not just once. Leo [DiCaprio] gets a great part every year Ã¢â¬Â¦ what about the black actors?\" asked rock. \"What about Jaime Fox? Ã¢â¬Â¦ Jaime Fox was so good in <em>Ray</em> that they went to the hospital and unplugged the real Ray Charles. 'We don't need to of these.' \" <br /><br />Rock's monologue was highly anticipated in a year in which diversity within the Academy ranks has been highly scrutinized. After <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/chris-rock-not-leaving-oscars-jokes\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">an outcry</a> following an <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/oscars-diversity-ceo-actors-members-speak-out\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">all-white acting slate</a> of nominees for the second year in a row, the Academy announced it would be enacting a \"sweeping series of substantive changes\" in order to increase diversity within its voting bodies. <br /><br />Backstage, Rock got a rave review from Adam McKay, who won for his screenplay for <em>The Big Short</em>. <br /><br />\"I thought it was great,\" McKay told reporters in the press room. \"I thought it was jabbing at Hollywood and at the same time even-handed and kind of dealing with a new era of how we discuss diversity. I thought it was very even handed and really impressive and really funny.\" <br /><br />Ahead of the ceremony, Rock tweeted a picture of himself fine tuning the monologue. <br /><br />\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"></blockquote></p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cutting the fat off my monologue <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/oscars?src=hash\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">#oscars</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ngMQD6LAkt\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">pic.twitter.com/ngMQD6LAkt</a></p>Ã¢ÂÂ Chris Rock (@chrisrock) </p>","<p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisrock/status/704105307731931136\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">February 29, 2016</a></p>","<p> <br />Rock, 51, previously hosted the Oscars in 2005. <br /><br />The 88th annual Awards are being presented live on ABC from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California.</p>"]},"property":"celebrity","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"video","is_eligible":"true","id":"a855f93f-61f5-3ebe-a6bf-4588b17797f5","title":"Parents of girls killed in plane crash speak to abc13","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/video/parents-girls-killed-plane-crash-231747075.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1280","height":"720","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aCAW3oHyDhLvMOH3jzRI1A--/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/video/video.krtk.abc.news.com/f1d8267a958b98601a66f3ba27455c28","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"640","height":"360","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VwER2seMhdDY4Gn_ySXixQ--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/video/video.krtk.abc.news.com/f1d8267a958b98601a66f3ba27455c28","tag":"img:640x?"}],"summary":"A Houston mother and father are grieving over the loss of their children who died yesterday in a plane crash in Grimes County.","categories":"YCT:001000291|YCT:001000288|YCT:001000992","publisher":"KTRK â Houston","provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/qI.oh1u9pAD8F2o27S0.2g--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://l.yimg.com/os/152/2012/10/25/ktrk-44x70-png_145514.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/index","site":"news","region":"us","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"84397933","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"84397933","site_attribute":"ctopid=\"18857489;18857989;1996000;1638500;12811500;1999000;2003000;12819500;2068500;1106000\" hashtag=\"18857489;18857989;1996000;1638500;12811500;1999000;2003000;12819500;2068500;1106000\" rs=\"lmsid:a097000000VKQUvAAP;revsp:video.krtk.abc.news.com;lpstaid:a855f93f-61f5-3ebe-a6bf-4588b17797f5\"","site":"news","region":"us","lang":"en-US"},"duration":"0:02:18","hosted":true,"publicationDate":"14 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo -

If youâre planning a quick trip to popular Walt Disney World or Disneyland with the kids anytime soon, you might have to shell out some big bucks. In a move to level out demand during peak attendance periods, Disney on Sunday introduced seasonal surge pricing for its US theme parks.

Obama announced the executive action in late 2014, but it was challenged in court by 26 states, which argued that he had overstepped his authority and that the program would impose an unfair financial burden on them.
