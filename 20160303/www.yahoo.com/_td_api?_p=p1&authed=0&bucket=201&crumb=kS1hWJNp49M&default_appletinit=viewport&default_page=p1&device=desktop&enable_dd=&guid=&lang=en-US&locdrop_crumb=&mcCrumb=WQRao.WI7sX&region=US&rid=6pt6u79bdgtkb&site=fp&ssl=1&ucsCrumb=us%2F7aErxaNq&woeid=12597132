He, in Iowa, would have been meeting with business people, small-biz people, asking their ideas,â Stevens continued. âHe would have been meeting with teachers and students and parents and talking about education. He would have been doing these things that candidates that want to succeed and are serious do.â </p>","<p> But âinstead, what heâs done is what he enjoys. Heâs at a point in his life where he doesnât do anything he doesnât enjoy,â the consultant said. âWhat does he enjoy? He likes having these big rallies and going out and ranting for an hour.

That's still 54 cents cheaper than at this time last year.</p> <p>Forecasters say prices should rise at least 30 cents or more by June. Demand will rise as people drive more, and supplies will tighten when refiners slow down to perform maintenance and switch to more expensive summer fuel blends.</p> <p>The U.S. Energy Department predicts that the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline will peak at $2.08 from June through August. Tom Kloza, an energy analyst with the Oil Price Information Service, says the peak will be between $2.10 and $2.50 a gallon.</p> <p>Either forecast would leave prices well below recent years. From 2011 to 2014, the national average on June 1 topped $3.60 and some places saw gas over $4. Last year, gas prices peaked in June at $2.80 a gallon.</p> <p>Gas is cheaper because a glut of crude has caused oil prices to tumble. Even with a 30 percent rally since Jan. 20, benchmark U.S. crude closed Tuesday down 68 percent from its June 2014 peak.</p> <p>Motorists may enjoy the relative bargain for a while. The Energy Department expects crude prices to average about $38 a barrel this year and $50 next year. That forecast was made before Saudi Arabia's oil minister forcefully rejected production cuts during a speech to a major oil-industry conference last week in Houston.</p> <p>Oil prices have been undercut by demand that turned out to be weaker than expected, especially in China and other developing countries. But for the most part, it's a case of oversupply â more crude is gushing into world markets than consumers and industry need.</p> <p>Last month, commercial inventories of U.S. crude topped 500 million barrels for the first time; they are more than one-third above their five-year average. Iran is expected to produce more oil now that it is free from international sanctions. And producers like Saudi Arabia, who could cut supply to prop up prices, are continuing to pump away instead.</p> <p>Lower oil prices have led to layoffs at drilling companies and contributed to weakness in the stock market, but cheaper gasoline and heating oil are putting more money in consumers' pockets.</p> <p>The U.S. Energy Department estimates that the average household saved $660 because of cheaper gas in 2015 and will save another $320 this year.</p> <p>Chris Christopher, director of consumer economics at research firm IHS, said consumers will gradually spend more of their gas savings as they believe that cheaper pump prices will last a while. More consumer spending should boost the economy.</p> <p>\"In West Texas, they are in a recession,\" Christopher said, \"but it's a net positive for the United States and most developed economies that don't depend too much on energy prices for their livelihood.\"</p> <p>Last year, the JPMorgan Chase Institute looked at records from 26 million debit and credit card holders and concluded that gas savings varied greatly by income and region. The card holders spent about 80 percent of their savings, almost 20 percent of it at restaurants. They also increased spending at department stores and on entertainment, electronics and appliances.</p> <p>The institute's CEO, Diana Farrell, said even though consumers are still saving money compared with 2015 gas prices, they might not spend it if they don't see the price at their gas station falling any lower. \"They may no longer feel like they have that extra money in their pocket,\" she said in an interview.</p> <p>Gasoline prices vary by region of the country. Californians usually pay among the highest gas prices, and on Tuesday the average for regular there was $2.41 a gallon â only Hawaiians paid more. Arizona had the cheapest average at $1.53 a gallon, according to AAA.</p> <p>A few stations even sold gas for under $1 last month, although they appeared to be marketing gimmicks, said AAA spokesman Michael Green.</p> <p>Several stations in Oklahoma City were under $1.10 in February, but that was before two refineries serving the central U.S. announced cutbacks in production because of low prices. On Tuesday, the best price in Oklahoma City was $1.45, according to GasBuddy.com.</p> <p>\"That flirtation with less-than-$1 gas is over,\" said Kloza, the oil analyst.</p> </p></p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":427,"width":640,"ratio":67,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/tcCWAhtb7WJYQyWWam17RQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0xO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/images/US_AHTTP_AP_FINANCIALTIMES/da559e553da20a0b920f6a706700e08b_original.jpg","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/uIJ4kTAxo3uV3EPpOkDq1Q--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/images/US_AHTTP_AP_FINANCIALTIMES/da559e553da20a0b920f6a706700e08b_original.jpg","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"3e1e2fe6-e418-3df4-962f-1a88fdf92775","licensed":"true","title":"Texans release franchise-leading rusher Arian Foster","link":"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/texans-release-franchise-leading-rb-arian-foster-152327807.html","summary":"Foster has played in just 25 games over the last three seasons.","entities":"WIKIID:Arian_Foster|WIKIID:Houston_Texans|WIKIID:Mike_McGear|WIKIID:The_Texans","autoplay":"true","categories":"YCT:001000001|YCT:001000002","publisher":"Shutdown Corner","author":"Shalise Manza Young","author_info":{"name":"Shalise Manza Young"},"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/OMestkg_Iv.t3iwABXi5Zw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://l.yimg.com/os/388/2011/10/21/shutdown-135x56_052756.jpg","site":"sports","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"2143969880","propertyRegion":"YPROP:sports","enable_lead":true,"ad_meta":{"spaceid":"2143969880","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Arian_Foster;Houston_Texans;Mike_McGear;The_Texans;Free_agent;Groin\" ctopid=\"2074500;2078500;2096000;2212000;2253000\" hashtag=\"2074500;2078500;2096000;2212000;2253000\" rs=\"revsp:99add987-dcd1-48ae-b801-e4aa58e4ebd0;lpstaid:3e1e2fe6-e418-3df4-962f-1a88fdf92775\"","site":"sports","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"1 hour 53 minutes ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo Sports - NBC Sports Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000001","score":"0.988148","label":"Sports & Recreation"},{"term":"YCT:001000002","score":"0.863636","label":"Football"}],"leadItem":true,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p><span class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n  <div style=\"left:0px;\" id=\"ymh-player-swf\" class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\">\n   <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><div class=\"js-video-placeholder RatioBox Bgc-x Bd-0\" data-yepConfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:true,&quot;page_space_id&quot;:&quot;2143969880&quot;,&quot;video_uuid&quot;:&quot;bdb1d176-e1f6-310e-a84f-3c172e33024b&quot;,&quot;device&quot;:&quot;desktop&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;sports&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{&quot;showTitle&quot;:true,&quot;showDescription&quot;:true,&quot;showButton&quot;:true,&quot;showProvider&quot;:false},&quot;width&quot;:640}\"></div></div>\n  </div></span>The free agent market is gaining another bold-name player: via a tweet from his agent and multiple reports, the Houston Texans are releasing running back Arian Foster.</p>","<p>The franchise's all-time leader in rushing yards, Foster has struggled mightily to get and stay on the field in his career due to injury, and played in just 25 of 48 games from 2013-2015.

It's an incredible read â especially its assertion that \"Hitler's anti-Semitism was not so violent or genuine as it sounded.\" This attitude was, apparently, widespread among Germans at the time; many of them saw Hitler's anti-Semitism as a ploy for votes among the German masses.</p>","<p>Times correspondent Cyril Brown spends<b> </b>most of the piece documenting the factors behind Hitler's early rise in Bavaria, Germany, including his oratorical skills, for example: \"he exerts an uncanny control over audiences, possessing the remarkable ability to not only rouse his hearers to a fighting pitch of fury, but at will turn right around and reduce the same audience to docile coolness.\"</p>","<p>But the really extraordinary part of the article is the three paragraphs on anti-Semitism. Brown acknowledges Hitler's vicious anti-Semitism as the core of Hitler's appeal â and notes the terrified Jewish community was fleeing from him â but goes on to dismiss it as a play to satiate the rubes (bolding mine):</p>","<blockquote> \n <p>He is credibly credited with being actuated by lofty, unselfish patriotism. He probably does not know himself just what he wants to accomplish. The keynote of his propaganda in speaking and writing is violent anti-Semitism. His followers are nicknamed the \"Hakenkreuzler.\" <b>So violent are Hitler's fulminations against the Jews that a number of prominent Jewish citizens are reported to have sought safe asylums in the Bavarian highlands</b>, easily reached by fast motor cars, whence they could hurry their women and children when forewarned of an anti-Semitic St. Bartholomew's night.</p> \n <p>But <b>several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler's anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers</b> and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes.</p> \n <p><b>A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism</b>, saying: \"You can't expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. <b>You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism.</b> It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you really are leading them.\"</p> \n</blockquote>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Now, Brown's sources in all likelihood did tell him that Hitler's anti-Semitism was for show. That was a popular opinion during Nazism's early days. But that speaks to how unprepared polite German society was for a movement as sincerely, radically violent as Hitler's to take power.</p>","<p>One other thing: if \"violent anti-Semitism\" was such a winning issue for Hitler, what does that tell us about the state of public opinion in Bavaria in 1922?</p>","<p>More from vox.com:</p>","<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11144752/super-tuesday-winners-losers\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">3 winners and 2 losers from SuperÂ Tuesday</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/a/presidential-primary-delegate-tracker\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Presidential primaries delegate tracker,Â 2016</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/3/2/11115974/lsd-internet-addiction\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Can very small doses of LSD make you a better worker?

Should she secure the nomination, they'll provide important clues about her priorities and challenges come November.</p></p>"],"remaining_body":["<p><p class=\"\"><b></b>Clinton's dominance in the South is real and underscores at least one important thing about her candidacy: She has the overwhelming trust and support of black voters. But as far as the general election concerned, the South isn't in play for Democrats. With the exception of Florida and Virginia, both of which are swing states, the GOPÂ has a lock on the South. In 2008, Obama managed to pull off a victory in North Carolina, but the rest of the South has remained faithful to the Republican nominee inÂ the past two presidential election cycles. For the foreseeable future, most of the Southern states that Clinton won on Tuesday â like Alabama and Tennessee â will not be part of any Democrat's path to the White House.</p></p>","<p>\n <blockquote class=\"q\">\n  When they compete in territory vital to succeeding in the general election, there's a very tight competition going on.\n </blockquote></p>","<p><p class=\"\">States like Colorado and Minnesota are states that Democrats need to carry in the general election. Sanders not only won them, but won them handily â according to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">latest results</a>, he beat Clinton by nearly 20 points in Colorado and by about 24 in Minnesota. His victories there are part of a broader pattern of him either winning or just barely losing states outside the South to Clinton. In other words, when Sanders and Clinton compete in territory that's vital to succeeding in the general election, there's a very tight competition going on.</p></p>","<p><p class=\"\">Now, it's worth bearing in mind that the primary electorate and the general electorate are very different. Primary voters tend to leanÂ <a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/primary-elections-candidate-ideology-out-step-primary-electorate\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">toward the more extreme views</a>Â of their party, providing only partial insight into how voters will act in a general election setting.Â </p></p>","<p><p class=\"\">That being said, attracting the kinds of voters likely to show up at primaries â people who feel more inspired to be civically engaged â are essential to driving the level of voter turnout needed to win a general election. Winning elections isn't only about being a desirable candidate, but also being a candidate so desirable that you can motivate people to get to the voting booth for you, or better yet, also work on convincing others to do so.</p></p>","<p><p class=\"\">If Sanders loses the nomination, it won't render his supporters irrelevant. Clinton and her advisers will have to figure out how to ensure that his followers won't be so demoralized that they won't turn out to vote in November. And the most straightforward way to do that is be more like Sanders: Adopt more of his policies, appropriate his populist affect and work harder than ever to convince voters that she's willing to take on powerful special interests.Â </p></p>","<p><p class=\"\">Clinton is different enough from Sanders ideologically that her attempt to woo his supportersÂ may just end up reinforcing a concern that already exists among some of the Democratic electorate â that she's willing to change her values and persona however she needs to in order to win. And that will be doubly difficult as the general election will also bring new pressure to appear more moderate to sway centrist voters in swing states.Â </p></p>","<p><p class=\"\">Such is the impossible task of being an American president: attempting to appeal to millions of people with often diametrically opposing views, all while desperately trying to convince them all that you're an honest person.</p></p>","<p>\n <div class=\"article-items\"></div></p>"]},"property":"news","images":[{"caption":"A different way of looking at it.","id":"d303d923-0a4b-3582-8497-83d59b6841c7","title":"One Fact About Bernie Sanders&#39; Super Tuesday Victories That Should Worry Hillary Clinton","type":"photo","shortCaption":"A different way of looking at it.","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/YuG9tza5aKDPAJo0EIc5jg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/mic_26/b1d84fc1f5d305f9283b70c416f15569","alt":"One Fact About Bernie Sanders&#39; Super Tuesday Victories That Should Worry Hillary Clinton"},"index":1},{"caption":"Hillary Clinton wins South Carolina as Bernie Sanders flops with black voters","id":"1e5b27d6-f19e-369d-a4bf-1529b7336345","title":"Hillary Clinton wins South Carolina as Bernie Sanders flops with black voters","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Hillary Clinton wins South Carolina as Bernie Sanders flops with black voters","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/m72gl4D8UmTmLgNnhf.lxA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/76b81a37b9ea8a6f9d3a74cc148b113a","alt":null},"index":2},{"caption":"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump won the most Super Tuesday delegates, while Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders each took several states.","id":"42711a7f-2bae-3b1f-9cf1-5ec50c14c987","title":"Clinton, Trump win big on Super Tuesday","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump won the most Super Tuesday delegates, while Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders each took several states.","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/UXQJLtiFaFCxLb5rVWhtDQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.wabc.abc.news.com/0a8767ce11c6690ce35dd97b90f3f599","alt":"Clinton, Trump win big on Super Tuesday"},"index":3},{"caption":"ABC News projects Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic primaries in Georgia and Virginia.
