The move follows a year of hearings in the Senate that lawmakers say allowed them to closely consider appropriate limits to place on the drug's use.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F_PIoGlVbNnPBuR6_FQj.g--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://l.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/151001/pot.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"640","height":"360"}},{"followId":"19a2f4e6-b427-11e5-bd68-fa163e2c24a6","name":"North Korean nuclear testing","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"cd8d6265-e781-34d6-b809-1da35db5f803","cluster_id":"19a2f4e6-b427-11e5-bd68-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"North Korea leader says will soon conduct nuclear warhead test: KCNA","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-leader-says-country-soon-conduct-nuclear-221315382.html","image_assets":[{"width":"450","height":"300","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GqmXhtSY00OQEzphvkjPKw--/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--1782997075.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BxjDoh6TqKgBkKp5Mr55Zw--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--1782997075.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dyIsJB_xn2pmpfdgvtON8Q--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--1782997075.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-03-15T08:21:53Z","summary":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country would soon conduct a nuclear warhead test and test launch ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, the official KCNA news agency reported on Tuesday.

Recruiters say engineers at once-buzzy companies like Dropbox Inc. and Twitter Inc.âwhich recently granted new stock awards to halt a wave of exitsânow take their calls. Yet the prospective hires are sizing up highly valued startups and the stock awards that come with them, wary of boarding a sinking ship.</p>","<p>Young companies count on luring workers with the promise of a huge potential upside for their equity awards, but that pitch has gotten tougher as stocks tumble and mutual funds reassess the value of their startup investments. Fidelity Investments, for example, in January marked down the value of its stakes in 13 of 26 startups valued at over $1 billion, according to the Journalâs startup stock tracker.</p>","<p>Shares of LinkedIn Corp. and VMware Inc. have dropped 56% and 40%, respectively, in the past year.

Offer acceptance rates have fallen about 5 percentage points from last year, and more candidates tell him they are talking with behemoths like Google Inc., attracted to the security that established companies can offer. One woman told him that her parents urged her to take a âsafeâ job with Google.</p>","<p>âPeople are anchoring ships in safe harbors,â Mr. Winter says.</p>","<p>Jason Henry for The Wall Street Journal Thumbtack received a flurry of job applications last fall after closing a funding round that valued the local-services website at well over $1 billion.</p>","<p>Redpoint Venturesâ head of talent Amy Knapp advises 15 to 20 startups on hiring matters, and says many recruits are now requesting chats with a startupâs investors during the recruiting process.

Potential hires now ask about the companyâs sinking share price. It closed at $9.83 on Tuesday, down from over $20 in October. After Pandoraâs latest quarterly earnings call, Ms. Wagener brought in the companyâs head of investor relations to instruct recruiters on explaining the results.</p>","<p>Adam Fishman, a 33-year-old growth and marketing executive who recently completed a hunt for a tech marketing job after his old employer closed its San Francisco office, says perks strike him as a sign that a firm isnât spending wisely.</p>","<p>âIâd rather have the company have a long lifespan than have a hoverboard riding around the office,â he says.</p>","<p>In postings for tech jobs, a more subdued tone has supplanted the hyperbolic rhetoric of last year, typified by an email that health-insurance brokerage Zenefits Inc. sent out to potential recruits describing an âEPICâ round of funding as a âLEGENDARYâ development.</p>","<p>An analysis conducted for the Journal by labor-market data firm Burning Glass Technologies found mentions of the word âexplosiveâ in job postings in San Mateo and Santa Clara countiesâthe heart of Silicon Valleyâwere down 15% this January and February, compared with the same period last year. On the rise are the confidence-inspiring phrases âventure capital,â up 61% over last year, and ârevenue,â up by 8%.</p>","<p>Signing bonuses have shrunk at cost-conscious companies, recruiters report, but havenât yet gone away. Candidates, meanwhile, push for cash compensation over equity stakes. And some managers are fighting to keep staff from fleeing. For example, Twitter is doling out cash bonuses and restricted stock to workers who have watched the companyâs stock drop 65% over the past year.</p>","<p>Compensation overall is holding steady. The average pay for tech jobs in the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas was $197,411 in 2015, according to labor-market analysis firm Economic Modeling Specialists International. The average value of equity stakes held by engineers, product managers and data scientists was $236,066 in February, according to Paysa Inc., which tracks compensation for those professions.</p>","<p>âI used to look at equity and think every company was going to be the next Facebook,â says a 29-year-old designer at a San Francisco startup. âNow when I see equity Iâm like, âThatâs nice but I want it in actual money.â â</p>","<p>The designer, who didn't want his name used since he is looking for a new job, is approaching his search cautiouslyâfor one, he wonât interview at companies planning to raise money in the near term.</p>","<p>Hailing the new sobriety are bosses like Aaron Bell, the chief executive of AdRoll Inc., a San Francisco advertising technology firm. âLast year, it felt more like a thunderdome match for talent,â he says.</p>","<p>After growing to 500 employees in 2014, Mr. Bell kept head count relatively steady in 2015, sensing trouble brewing in the capital markets. AdRoll added relatively few full-time hires in 2015, preferring engineering contractors instead. Late last year, the company became profitable.</p>","<p>As AdRoll ramps up hiring, Mr. Bell says the engineers he is wooing appear to have fewer competing offers. The share of engineering candidates accepting jobs is up 30% this year compared with 2015, Mr. Bell says. Retention rates among existing staff have improved, too.</p>","<p>As companies tighten their belts further, recruiters themselves may be the ones on the outs. GoPro Inc. and Instacart Inc. shed recruiters in recent months, and Pandora ended four recruitersâ contracts in December, according to Ms. Wagener. The company intends to fill 700 jobs this year, down from 900 in 2015.</p>","<p>Chris DâElia, a recruiter at 11-person mobile-application startup Swipe Labs Inc., has been pleased that engineers at Twitter are taking his calls.

Denzel Valentine, G, Michigan State</strong></p>","<p>Years ago, Valentine would stand outside the Michigan State locker room with hats or shirts for players to sign,Â  Now he is who today's Lansing kids come see after a season in which he has averaged 19.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.6 assists.</p>","<p><strong>2. Buddy Hield, G, Oklahoma</strong></p>","<p>Oklahoma's smiling assassin is college basketball's most lethal scorer. He averages 25.0 points per game and his 3-point percentage has actually <em>dipped</em> to 46.4. In an epic triple-overtime loss to Kansas this season, he had 46 points on 23 shots.</p>","<p><strong>3. Tyler Ulis, G, Kentucky</strong></p>","<p>Kentucky is lucky top Class of 2014 point guard target Emmanuel Mudiay chose SMU over the Wildcats. Otherwise they likely wouldn't have pursued Ulis and the first-team All-American might be starring for Michigan State instead.</p>","<p><strong>4. Malcolm Brogdon, G, Virginia</strong></p>","<p>Maybe the nation's best perimeter defender, the ACC's player of the year is also Virginia's top scoring threat. Brogdon averages 18.7 points per game despite the Cavaliers' methodical tempo.</p>","<p><strong>5. Jakob Poeltl, C, Utah</strong></p>","<p>Utah assistant Andy Hill spotted Poeltl on the first day of the 2013 U-18 European Championships. Three years later, the skilled Austrian 7-footer is the Pac-12 player of the year and a projected NBA lottery pick.</p>","<p><strong>6. Yogi Ferrell, G, Indiana</strong></p>","<p>The only thing missing from Ferrell's resume at Indiana is a long NCAA tournament run. The senior point guard will try to change that this March after leading the Hoosiers to a second Big Ten title in four years this season.</p>","<p><strong>7. Brice Johnson, F, North Carolina</strong></p>","<p>Tar Heels fans will overlook the fact Johnson is dating <a href=\"http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4200&ATCLID=210229613\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">a Duke women's basketball player.</a> After all, the 6-foot-9 senior is averaging a double-double this season and racked up 48 points and 40 rebounds in two games against the Blue Devils.</p>","<p><strong>8. Jarrod Uthoff, F, Iowa</strong></p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Once best known for being the player Bo Ryan blocked from transferring, Uthoff has shown why the Wisconsin coach wanted him so badly. The 6-foot-9 senior is averaging 18.9 points, 6.4 rebounds and 2.7 blocks.</p>","<p><strong>9. Kris Dunn, G, Providence</strong></p>","<p>Once a favorite for national player of the year, Dunn has faded a bit since opponents began clogging the lane and daring Providence to shoot from the perimeter. He's still averaging 16 points and 5.6 assists, but turnovers have been a bugaboo.</p>","<p><strong>10. Grayson Allen, G, Duke</strong></p>","<p>When he's not <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaab-the-dagger/duke-s-grayson-allen-can-t-seem-to-stop-tripping-opposing-players-052436942.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">tripping opponents</a>, Allen is typically scoring on them. The hero of last year's national title game has proven that was no fluke, averaging 21.6 points and shooting 41.6 percent from behind the arc.</p>","<p><strong>11. Georges Niang, F, Iowa State</strong></p>","<p>In addition to averaging 19.8 points on 54.8 percent shooting, Niang delivered one of this year's most poignant senior night speeches. \"As I got on the court and saw all 14,000 of you guys, I realized I'm not leaving,\" Niang told the Hilton Coliseum crowd. \"I've got a home forever in Ames.\"</p>","<p><strong>12. </strong><strong>Perry Ellis, F, Kansas</strong></p>","<p>No, Perry Ellis was not a starter at Kansas since the Naismith era. It just seems that way. The soft-spoken senior is closing in on a spot in Kansas' all-time top 10 in both scoring and rebounding.</p>","<p><strong>13. Jamal Murray, G, Kentucky</strong></p>","<p>Firing off fake arrows has become Murray's trademark celebration after burying a 3-pointer, and he's had ample opportunity to do it lately. The Kentucky freshman is averaging 20.1 points per game and shooting well over 40 percent from the field.</p>","<p><strong>14. Domantas Sabonis, F, Gonzaga</strong></p>","<p>The son of one of the greatest international players in the history of basketball,Â Arvydas Sabonis, Domantas has drawn intrigue among NBA scouts with his mix of physicality and skill. He is averaging 17.4 points and 11.6 rebounds for the Zags.</p>","<p><strong>15. Ben Bentil, F, Providence</strong></p>","<p>The nation's most improved player has evolved from role player, to Kris Dunn's sidekick, to a bonafide co-star. Bentil is averaging 21.2 points and 7.8 rebounds, and you can make a compelling case he was the Friars' MVP in Big East play.</p>","<p><strong>16. Monte Morris, G, Iowa State</strong></p>","<p>How deft a distributor is Morris? His assist-to-turnover ratio is nearly 4-to-1. That's ridiculous. Niang is Iowa State's premier scorer, but Morris is the engine that drives the Cyclones' fast-paced, free-flowing attack.</p>","<p><strong>17. Brandon Ingram, F, Duke</strong></p>","<p>If it indeed is no longer a foregone conclusion that Ben Simmons will be taken No. 1 overall this June, then that's a testament to Ingram's development. The rapidly improving freshman scored 20 or more points six times in ACC play.</p>","<p><strong>18. Kyle Wiltjer, F, Gonzaga</strong></p>","<p>One of the best scorers in college basketball, Wiltjer can hurt opposing defenses in numerous ways. The 6-foot-10 forward can post up smaller defenders or rain down pick-and-pop jump shots if he has a big man on him.</p>","<p><strong><span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1458148411828\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Right\"><img title=\"Wichita State senior Fred VanVleet (Travis Heying/The Wichita Eagle via AP)\" alt=\"Wichita State senior Fred VanVleet (Travis Heying/The Wichita Eagle via AP)\" class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/g7gJVpO_KldzFbu9Ug1X6g--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MzEwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Sports/ap/201602271827664429213\" width=\"310\" /></span></span></span>19. Fred VanVleet, G, Wichita State</strong></p>","<p>He's already been part of Wichita State teams that reached the Final Four, completed an undefeated regular season and toppled in-state rival Kansas to advance to a Sweet 16. Now the elite point guard will try to make some more March history.</p>","<p><strong>20. A.J. Hammons, C, Purdue</strong></p>","<p>Since reentering Purdue's starting five three games into Big Ten play, Hammons has shed his reputation for immaturity and played to his full potential. The 7-footer is averaging 14.9 points and 8.0 rebounds and earned BIg Ten defensive player of the year honors.</p>","<p><strong>21. Melo Trimble, G, Maryland</strong></p>","<p>His outside shooting slump is a major concern for Maryland. Unless Trimble starts knocking down threes, teams will keep going under screens and it will be harder and harder for him to get into the lane and create.</p>","<p><strong>22. Isaiah Whitehead, G, Seton Hall</strong></p>","<p>Can a guy shooting below 40 percent from the field really be one of the 25 best players in the nation? Yes. Whitehead is averaging 18.4 points and 5.0 assists and has put defensive-oriented Seton Hall on his back recently in leading the Pirates to an NCAA bid.</p>","<p><strong>23. Josh Hart, G, Villanova</strong></p>","<p>If Villanova is going to exorcise its NCAA tournament demons this week, the second-seeded Wildcats need Hart to come up big. The 6-foot-5 wing averages 15.5 points and 6.9 rebounds and is also the team's best perimeter defender.</p>","<p><strong>24. Dillon Brooks, F, Oregon</strong></p>","<p>One of the keys to Oregon's success is Brooks' ability to create mismatches at one end and neutralize them at the other. The 6-foot-6 small-ball power forward uses his quickness to score 16.8 points per game and his strength to keep opponents from hurting Oregon on the block or glass.</p>","<p><strong>25. Josh Scott, C, Colorado</strong></p>","<p>The biggest difference between Colorado's 2014-15 CBI team and 2015-16 NCAA tournament team? One is the departure of volume-shooting Askia Booker. Two is the health of Scott. The 6-10 senior is the Pac-12's best big man who does not hail from Austria.</p>","<p><strong>26. Deandre Bembry, F, Saint Joseph's</strong></p>","<p>If you haven't seen the Atlantic 10 player of the year yet, carve out a few minutes to watch him. The statsheet-stuffing forward did a little of everything for St. Joseph's this season, scoring 17.3 points, grabbing 7.7 rebounds and dishing out 4.5 assists.</p>","<p><strong>27. Gary Payton II, G, Oregon State</strong></p>","<p>First Oregon State had the glove. Now it has the mitten. Twenty-six years after his dad led the Beavers to their last NCAA tournament bid, they're back behind the younger Payton, a dynamic point guard who like his father is an elite defender.</p>","<p><strong>28. Demetrius Jackson, G, Notre Dame</strong></p>","<p>One reason Notre Dame limped into the NCAA tournament dropping four of seven is that its point guard is slumping. Jackson's season-long 15.5 points and 4.8 assists per game are still very good, but he has shot 27.8 percent from the field during that stretch.</p>","<p><strong>29. Nigel Hayes, F, Wisconsin</strong></p>","<p>Put Hayes in front of a microphone and good things happen. The Toledo native's best moment this season? This zinger at Ohio State's expense.</p>","<p><div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7tfiPK5HhUo\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div></p>","<p>Mic drop, indeed.</p>","<p><strong>30. </strong><strong><strong>Jameel Warney, F, Stony Brook</strong><br /></strong></p>","<p>Maybe the most dominant player at a small-conference program this season, Warney dragged hard-luck Stony Brook to its first NCAA bid after numerous previous near misses. He averaged 19.8 points and 10.7 rebounds and scored 43 points on 22 shots in the America East title game.</p>","<p><strong>31. </strong><strong>Ryan Anderson, F, Arizona</strong></p>","<p>Though teams with length and athleticism inside can swallow up the undersized Anderson, the Boston College transfer is a crafty scorer and an effective rebounder. He averages a double-double with 15.5 points and 10.1 rebounds.</p>","<p><strong>32. Taurean Prince, F, Baylor</strong></p>","<p>Overlooked by major colleges in Texas, Prince initially signed with LIU Brooklyn before changing his mind when its coach left and Baylor began showing interest. The Bears are glad he did because the 6-foot-7 forward has emerged as a do-it-all forward and an NBA prospect.</p>","<p><strong>33. A.J. English, G, Iona</strong></p>","<p>There may not be a better marriage of scorer and system nationally than A.J. English and Iona. The 6-foot-4 senior is averaging 22.4 points per game and has the freedom to fire at will.</p>","<p><strong>34. Michael Gbinije, G, Syracuse</strong></p>","<p>Gbinije has gone from afterthought at Duke to star at Syracuse. The smooth, steady senior is averaging an efficient 17.8 points and is also Syracuse's best playmaker.</p>","<p><strong>35. Jaylen Brown, F, Cal</strong></p>","<p>Consistency is the one thing lacking from the future lottery pick's game. The bulldozing 6-foot-7 forward has scored 20 or more points six times this season and has failed to crack double digits six others.</p>","<p><strong>36. Sheldon McClellan, G, Miami</strong></p>","<p>One half of a dynamic transfer-led Miami backcourt, McClellan averages an efficient 15.8 points per game and gets to the foul line early and often. McClellan arrived from Texas. Point guard Angel Rodriguez came via Kansas State.</p>","<p><strong>37. Frank Mason, G, Kansas</strong></p>","<p>When ESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla listed Mason as the Big 12's sixth best point guard, the Kansas standout didn't forget the snub. He took to Twitter after thoroughly outplaying Texas' Isaiah Taylor a few weeks ago and wrote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/F_Mason0/status/704541353091440640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">\"6th best PG in the Big 12\" but what is my team?\"</a> Big 12 champs, Frank. Again.</p>","<p><strong>38. Ivan Rabb, F, Cal</strong></p>","<p>While Rabb has scored in double figures his last seven games, it's his impact on Cal's outstanding defense that elevates him this high on the list. The 6-foot-11 freshman'is mobility and length allow him to defend pick-and-rolls effectively and alter shots around the rim.Â </p>","<p><strong>39. Trevon Bluiett, F, Xavier</strong></p>","<p>Big East assistant on Xavier's star sophomore: \"If you have to take one guy away, it's Bluiett. You have to try to make him a two-point shooter and make him work for everything.\"</p>","<p><strong>40. Roosevelt Jones, F, Butler<br /></strong></p>","<p>This is how assistant coach Terry Johnson <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/columnists/gregg-doyel/2016/03/08/doyel-awkwardly-awesome-roosevelt-jones/81446658/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">described Jones to the Indianapolis Star</a> earlier this season: âYou know what position he plays? He plays SOB.â Great line, and indeed the awkward, crafty 6-foot-4 Jones defies definition while averaging 14.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.7 assists.</p>","<p><strong>41. Joel Bolomboy, F, Weber State</strong></p>","<p>For the first time since Damian Lillard graduated, NBA scouts are showing up to Weber State games again. The reason is Joel Bolomboy, a 6-foot-9 senior forward averaging 17.2 points and 12.7 rebounds for the Big Sky champs.</p>","<p><strong>42. Anthony Gill, F, Virginia</strong></p>","<p>The departure of Darion Atkins left Virginia without its most versatile defender. The departure of Justin Anderson left Virginia without one of its most dependable scorers. Gill has helped fill both those holes while serving as co-star to Malcolm Brogdon.</p>","<p><strong>43. Michael Young, F, Pittsburgh</strong></p>","<p>How consistent has Young been for Pittsburgh? The junior averagesÂ 16.1 points, 7.1 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game and has scored in double figures in 28 of the Panthers' 30 games.</p>","<p><strong>44. Jalen Jones, F, Texas A&M</strong></p>","<p>The first-team all-SEC forward is Texas A&M's most consistent scorer and rebounder. He's a huge reason the Aggies have gone from missing the NCAA tournament last season to a co-SEC title and a No. 3 seed this year.</p>","<p><strong>45. Isaiah Taylor, G, Texas</strong></p>","<p>He's still not an efficient scorer, but the volume-shooting Taylor has improved as a distributor under Shaka Smart. The point guard is averaging 14.8 points and 4.9 assists and is the biggest catalyst for Texas earning a No. 6 seed in the NCAA tournament.</p>","<p><strong>46. Wade Baldwin, G, Vanderbilt</strong></p>","<p>Though Baldwin's scoring has taken a nice leap since last season, he still has considerable room for growth in his decision making with the ball in his hands. Baldwin needs to elevate his shooting percentage and diminish his turnovers.</p>","<p><strong><span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1458148411830\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Right\"><img title=\"Allonzo Trier (Photo by Chris Coduto/Getty Images)\" alt=\"Allonzo Trier (Photo by Chris Coduto/Getty Images)\" class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/SUZUt9ZKbKFVx5KwVhePmA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MzEwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/gettyimages.com/long-beach-state-v-arizona-20151223-043821-858.jpg\" width=\"310\" /></span></span></span>47. Allonzo Trier, G, Arizona</strong></p>","<p>The key to Trier's success as a freshman this season was learning to defend well enough for Sean Miller to trust him. His improvement defensively coupled with his ability to attack the rim or shoot from deep has been key for Arizona.</p>","<p><strong>48. Kelan Martin, F, Butler </strong></p>","<p>What a revelation Martin has been this season for a Butler team that wins with offense not defense this season. The sophomore forward contributes 16.1 points per game for a team ranked No. 19Â in adjusted efficiency.</p>","<p><strong>49. Devin Williams, F, West Virginia</strong></p>","<p>After struggling down the stretch in the regular season, Williams erupted in the Big 12 tournament, averaging 19 points and 11 rebounds over three games and shooting 62 percent from the floor. West Virginia needs more of that from the goggled junior.</p>","<p><strong>50. Zach Auguste, F, Notre Dame</strong></p>","<p>Already a skilled, efficient scorer in the paint last season, Auguste has improved his rebounding dramatically this season. He has cracked double figures in each of his last six games including 22 against Duke in the ACC tournament.Â </p>","<p><strong>51. London Perrantes, G, Virginia</strong></p>","<p>The reason you can't speed Virginia up is Perrantes, a point guard who controls tempo better than anyone and also has shown a knack for sinking big shots. The Los Angeles native is the perfect floor general for a Tony Bennett team.</p>","<div> \n <p><strong>52. Damian Jones, C, Vanderbilt</strong></p> \n</div>","<p>There are two Vanderbilt players on this list. 7-foot sharpshooter Luke Kornet could easily have been a third. So how was Vanderbilt so decidedly mediocre all season?</p>","<p><strong>53. Isaiah Cousins, G, Oklahoma<br /></strong></p>","<p>A capable defender with an accurate outside shot and a dangerous mid-range game, Cousins can score at all three levels. He is averaging 13.0 points, 4.6 rebound and 4.6 assists for an Oklahoma team that earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament.</p>","<p><strong>54. Julian Jacobs, G, USC </strong></p>","<p>Explosive off the dribble and an excellent on-ball defender, Jacobs has emerged as USC's most indispensable player. He has averaged 11.8 points and a Pac-12-best 5.5 assists for a USC team that has made a huge jump this season.</p>","<p><strong>55. Wayne Selden, G, Kansas</strong></p>","<p>Big 12 assistant on Selden's inconsistency: \"Wayne Selden surprises you with his lack of confidence when he misses one. I know that sounds crazy, but he'll make one and it changes the way he approaches the rest of them.\"</p>","<p><strong>56. Marcus Paige, G, North Carolina</strong></p>","<p>This ranking is partially on reputation, partially out of respect for Paige's leadership qualities and partially because he's still maybe the most important player on a national title contender. Paige has regressed for a second straight year playing off ball, but he's averaging 12.1 points and 3.7 assists.</p>","<p><strong>57. Justin Sears, F, Yale</strong></p>","<p>Yale's first Ivy League title and NCAA tournament bid since 1962 would not have been possible without Sears' contributions. He averaged 15.8 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.8 blocks, helping the Bulldogs earn a No. 12 seed.</p>","<p><strong>58. Diamond Stone, C, Maryland</strong></p>","<p>The most skilled low-post scorer in this year's freshman class, Stone has developed nicely at Maryland. He scores with his back to the basket and is a target for Melo Trimble when opposing defenses collapse on the point guard.</p>","<p><strong>59. Bryn Forbes, G, Michigan State</strong></p>","<p>If there's a shooter having a better season than Forbes, it's probably Stephen Curry. The Michigan State senior is hitting an incredible 48.4 percent of his 3-pointers, forcing opposing defenses to mark him at all times and creating space for his teammates as a result.</p>","<p><strong>60. Quentin DeCosey, G, Temple<br /></strong></p>","<p>The only other unanimous selection on the American Athletic Conference's all-league team besides Bembry, DeCosey has enjoyed an excellent season. The versatile senior is averaging 15.6 points, 6.0 rebounds and 2.6 assists.</p>","<p><strong>61. Ron Baker, G, Wichita State</strong></p>","<p>His shooting percentages have dropped a bit this season because he has been asked to do so much, but Baker is still one of the nation's elite wings. Fred VanVleet's co-star is averaging 14.2 points and score off the dribble or from deep.</p>","<p><strong>62. Thomas Walkup, F, Stephen F. Austin</strong></p>","<p>The MVP of the Southland Conference has Stephen F. Austin back in the NCAA tournament for a third straight year. He finished the season on a high note too with a Feb. 29 triple double and then a 37-point eruption less than a week later.</p>","<p><strong>63. Tonye Jekiri, C, Miami</strong></p>","<p>If Jekiri isn't the nation's best defensive center, he's certainly high on the list. The Nigerian-born 7 footer alters shots around the rim, rebounds and blows up pick-and-rolls with his mobility on the perimeter.</p>","<p><strong>64. Chris Boucher, F, Oregon</strong></p>","<p>He's one of the keys to Oregon's success at both ends. On offense, his outside shooting forces opposing big men out of the paint and clears the lane for Oregon's drivers. On defense, his shot blocking presence gives the Ducks freedom to choke off the passing lanes and gamble for steals.</p>","<p><strong>65. Marvelle Harris, G, Fresno State</strong></p>","<p>It's a shame the Mountain West was so mediocre this season because Harris probably deserved more attention nationally. The high-scoring guard is a tough shot maker â as evidenced by some of the deep threes at the shot clock buzzer he sank Saturday against San Diego State.</p>","<p><strong>66. Charles Cooke, G, Dayton</strong></p>","<p>With Dyshawn Pierre unavailable the first 11 games of the season and Kendall Pollard fighting through injuries more recently, Cooke has been Dayton's most consistent player. The James Madison transfer has averaged 15.7 points and 6.0 rebounds while also playing solid defense.</p>","<p><strong>67. Wes Washpun, G, Northern Iowa</strong></p>","<p>The hero of Northern Iowa's Missouri Valley title game victory over Evansville is a 6-foot-1 senior from Cedar Rapids. Washpun leads the Panthers at 14.6 points per game and also has a 2-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio.</p>","<p><strong>68. Daniel Hamilton, G, UConn</strong></p>","<p>While Hamilton is still not an efficient scorer for UConn, he contributes in so many ways.

The study examined the <a href=\"http://sites.duke.edu/dukeresearch/2016/03/07/in-the-land-of-fantasy-inequality-is-benign/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"> socioeconomic status of characters in 32 G-rated films </a> and found a kind of Lake Woebegone effect: The wealthy were overrepresented, poverty was glamorized and upward mobility seemed effortless.</p>","<p>âInequality in these movies is downplayed, sanitized and even erased,â Duke sociology professor Jessi Streib, lead author of the study, tells me in the video above. âPoor characters donât suffer any hardships, working class characters love being working class, and upper-class characters look out for the working class and the poor, so thereâs no reason to be upwardly mobile.â</p>","<p>To the cynical among you: Okay, go and ahead and groan. Theyâre just movies. Kids donât need to learn about economic hardship from entertainment. Thatâs what parents and schools are supposed to do. And if Disney (<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DIS\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">DIS</a>) and Pixar started working economic education into their films, theyâd undoubtedly get pilloried for teaching a version of capitalism somebody or other disagreed with.</p>","<p>Yet rising income inequality is clearly a dominant issue of our timeâand besides, some of the messages in popular films are kind of weird. In \"Beauty and the Beast\"âwhich IMDB ranks as the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/list/ls005779038?ref_=tt_rls_1\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">second-best Disney movie of all time</a>âthe princeâs servants dance happily while singing, âLife is so unnerving, for a servant whoâs not serving. Heâs not whole without a soul to wait upon.â Not exactly a nursery rhyme most parents want their children to memorize.</p>","<p>In \"Ratatouille,\" which was released in 2007, Remi the rat and his family are poor, living in the sewers, yet the main references to poverty involve not hardship, but poor taste in food among the lower class. Cheerfulness amid squalor seems to be an enduring theme of childrenâs movies, in fact. In the original \"Snow White,\" released in 1938, the dwarves extoll the virtues of working in a diamond mine, which in the real world evokes images of a dusty, dangerous and miserable workplace. âTo dig dig dig dig dig dig dig is what we really like to do,â the dwarves sing. Pass the breathing mask.</p>","<p>The Duke study found, in the 32 films analyzed, that 31% of the main characters were upper class, while 4.5% were poor. Thereâs no consensus on what exactly constitutes rich and poor in the real world, but there are obviously far more poor people and far fewer rich than depicted in the movies.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>The study also found a âfalse parallelâ between the travails of the rich and the poor. In \"Aladdin,\" for example, the title character is a street urchin who has to steal food to survive, while his newfound friend, Jasmine, is a princess bored with the trappings of wealth. While Aladdin describes his hardscrabble life dodging the authorities, Jasmine complains that sheâs not free to make her own choices. Their laments converge when they both utter the word âtrappedâ simultaneously, as if the plight of a poor hustler equals the challenges faced by a self-absorbed 1 percenter.</p>","<p>Does it matter if kidsâ films gloss over economic hardship? âThese are the first messages kids receive about social class and inequality,â says Streib. âTheyâre very powerful. We should show that poverty is really a tough experience. A lot of people donât go from rags to riches the way these movies portray.â That, of course, is one reason people go to the movies in the first place.</p>","<p><em>Rick Newmanâs latest book is </em> <a href=\"http://www.rickjnewman.com/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"><em>Liberty for All: A Manifesto for Reclaiming Financial and Political Freedom.</em></a> <em> Follow him on Twitter: </em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/rickjnewman\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"><em>@rickjnewman</em></a><em>.</em></p>"]},"property":"finance"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"d1e24f14-b243-3749-ac61-21ebad9239cb","licensed":"true","title":"Mom Moved to Tears by Birthday Party Invitation Sent Home With Her Son","link":"https://gma.yahoo.com/mom-moved-tears-birthday-party-invitation-sent-home-121828006--abc-news-parenting.html","summary":"A Canadian mom was moved to tears after her son brought home a birthday party invitation accompanied by a touching letter penned by a class mom, whom she&#39;d never met.  &quot;It was an ugly cry for me that day,&quot; Tricia Klein of Brantford, Ontario, told ABC News.
