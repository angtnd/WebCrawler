needed to combat the Zika virus until June, including for the fast-tracking of vaccines, diagnostics and research studies into how it spreads.</p>","<p>The funds, including $25 million for the WHO and its regional office, would also be used to control the mosquito-borne virus that has spread to 39 countries, including 34 in the Americas, and has been linked to birth defects in Brazil.</p>","<p>âPossible links with neurological complications and birth malformations have rapidly changed the risk profile for Zika from a mild threat to one of very serious proportions,â WHO director-general Margaret Chan said in the WHO Strategic Response Framework and Joint Operations Plan issued in Geneva.</p>","<p>The WHO expects the funds to come from member states and other donors and said that in the meantime it has tapped a new Â  emergency contingency fund for $2 million to finance its initial operations.</p>","<p>Chan will travel to Brazil from Feb 22-24 to review Zika-related measures supported by WHO and will meet the health minister, a WHO spokeswoman said.</p>","<p><b>Related:<i> <a

risk of it persisting in semen and urine.</p>","<p> âThere is currently very little evidence of mother-to-child transmission; however, intra-uterine infections seem to be associated with subsequent neurological conditions in the child.â</p>","<p>Research studies are needed to assess the presence of the Zika virus in semen and other body fluids, including pregnancy-related fluids, and potential

Such a response was used by Apple in a case last October when it told a New York judge it couldn&#8217;t unlock an iOS device running iOS 8 or higher. The work phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, the San Bernadino shooter whose handset the FBI is trying to access, runs iOS 9. Apple introduced the tougher system in 2014 with the launch of iOS 8 following Edward Snowden&#8217;s government surveillance revelations. \n Related:Â  Read Tim Cook&#8217;s strong stance on privacy and encryption \n Judge Pym&#8217;sÂ court order marks the latest chapter in the ongoing battle between tech firms and policy makers overÂ privacy and security in the digital world. Apple chief Tim Cook has stated on many occasions his support for unbreakable encryption for users. The CEO vehemently opposes granting investigators access to private data held on Apple&#8217;s mobile devices, an act the company saysÂ would damage customer trust. \n According to the Associated Press , which first reported Judge Pym&#8217;s decision, investigators are hoping the phone&#8217;s data will reveal information about who Farook and his wife communicated with and places they visited in lead up to the shooting. Â The pair were apparently careful to physically destroy two other personal handsets, preventingÂ the FBI from extracting any information from them. \n Speaking to members of Congress last week, FBI director James Comey touched on the case, saying his investigators had so far been unable to gain access to a phone connected with the San Bernardino shooting. \n Related: Terrorists will evade encryption backdoor net, according to study \n &#8220;It is a big problem for law enforcement armed with a search warrant when you find a device that can&#8217;t be opened even when a judge says there&#8217;s probable cause to open it,&#8221; the FBI chief said, adding, &#8220;It affects our counterterrorism work&#8230;.we still have one of those killers&#8217; phones that we have not been able to open, and it&#8217;s been over two months and we&#8217;re still working on it.&#8221; \n Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, gunned down 14 people on December 2 at an event for Farook&#8217;s co-workers. The pair later died in a shootout with police. The FBI believes their attack was at least partly inspired by ISIS, as Malik&#8217;s Facebook page showed a message pledging allegiance to the group. \n As for Apple, it has five days to inform the LA court if it has an issue with its ruling. \n [UPDATE:] Late Tuesday, Tim Cook offered a robust responseÂ to the ruling in an open letter to Apple customers. \n He wrote that while Apple has worked hard with the FBI to help find out more about &#8220;this horrible crime,&#8221; the security service has now asked the company &#8220;for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.&#8221; \n Cook said the FBI wants Apple &#8220;to make a new version of the iPhone operating system&#8221; that would circumvent important security features to give it access to Farook&#8217;s phone. \n He even goes so far as to describe the implications of the governmentâs demands as &#8220;chilling.&#8221; \n The CEO notes, &#8220;In the wrong hands, this software â which does not exist today â would have the potential to unlockÂ anyÂ iPhone in someoneâs physical possession,&#8221; ending with the message, &#8220;We are challenging the FBIâs demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country. We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications.&#8221; \n Cook&#8217;s letter can be found on Apple&#8217;s websiteÂ  here . \n \n \n Also watch: Apple iPhone 6S Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Please enable Javascript to watch this video","id":"a48449e0-668f-3e9b-84f9-8830619c6c0e","title":"Tim Cook denounces âchillingâ FBI demands","type":"photo","shortCaption":"The thorny issue of encryption is back in the headlines after a U.S. magistrate ordered Apple to help the FBI access the iPhone of one of the shooters in December&#8217;s San Bernardino attack . \n Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of U.S. District Court ...","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/c67xO9.aETLT2dPR0TU3Sw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/digital_trends_973/e4231245c6af0fe8ea4cf8b39fef9181","alt":"Tim Cook denounces âchillingâ FBI demands"},"index":2},{"caption":"FILE - In this April 30, 2015, file photo, Apple CEO Tim Cook responds to a question during a news conference at IBM Watson headquarters, in New York.

And she has grappled with how to help students heal after the deaths, she said. </p>","<p> \"Nightline\" co-anchor Byron Pitts traveled to Palo Alto recently and spoke to Herrmann about how students have worked together to cope with the tragedy. </p>","<p> Efforts to deal with the suicide cluster include a program to teach students techniques to handle stress through yoga and breathing exercises, a program that brings in recent alumni to talk about life after high school and one that matches incoming freshman with adults so that they can meet throughout the year and get one-on-one attention, Herrmann said. </p>","<br>","<br>","<p> And it's not just the administrators who are stepping up to help, but the students as well, she told Pitts. </p>","<p> \"We want to make sure that everyone knows it's okay to seek help if you're feeling blue, down, anxious,\" she said. \"So, students have made sure they've written stories, they've done videos. Actually, some of our students teamed up to do a documentary.\" </p>","<p> One of the students who wanted to share her story was Chen. As the editor of the student newspaper, she said she knew she wanted to do something to help, especially after seeing how many media stories focused on why the cluster happened and not how to recover. </p>","<p> When a suicide happened after Chen started attending Gunn High School, \"a lot of the media came in and were investigating and said 'Why are these kids killing themselves?'\" Chen recalled. \"It was being prodded apart, like a wound.\" </p>","<p> Chen said she came up with a new idea for sharing positive student stories after hearing Madelyn Gould speak at a community meeting about how the stories of recovery can reach those who are suicidal. </p>","<p> \"We have research that shows stories about resilience and coping and dealing with suicidal thoughts in ways that are engaging ... they are not only inspiring, they can prevent somebody else's suicide attempt,\" Gould told ABC News. </p>","<p> Chen said after hearing Gould speak, she knew she wanted to provide an outlet for students. \"What about if we provide that in the student paper?'\" Chen recalled thinking. </p>","<p> Chen started a new section for the paper this year called \"Changing the Narrative,\" aimed at having students at the elite school share essays of their fears and anxieties. </p>","<p> \"The website went up and they said 'Thank you for sharing it,'\" she said of her fellow students. </p>","<p> Two other high school seniors, Christian Leong and Andrew Baer, at Palo Alto High School also shared their story in a documentary called \"Unmasked,\" talking about the pressures of academic life. </p>","<p> The school board last year approved funding so that two licensed therapists could be at both Gunn High School and Palo Alto High School full time. There have been multiple community meetings to address concerns about the high stress environment at Gunn High School and potential risks to students' well-being if they take multiple advanced placement courses. The school board now recommends that students take no more than two AP classes. </p>","<p> In addition, Gunn High School started \"block\" scheduling this year -- meaning the class period is longer but they have fewer classes in a day. And school officials are also working to combat \"academic bullying\" on social media so that there is a less competitive atmosphere on campus. </p>","<p> \"Any time you are trying to intimidate, it doesn't matter if it's with strength or other things, if it's intimidating others with academic strength it still could have a negative or harmful impact,\" Herrmann said. </p>","<br>","<br>","<p> Dr. Meg Durbin, a family physician in Palo Alto, had three sons who attended Gunn High School during the first suicide cluster. The deaths galvanized her and others in the medical community to make mental health a consistent topic, she told ABC News, noting that students have learned to expect questions about their mental health during every checkup. </p>","<p> Durbin helped co-found HEARD -- the Health Care Alliance for Response to Adolescent Depression -- and also helped create a program to facilitate getting teens to mental health care providers. </p>","<p> Even in an affluent community like Palo Alto, \"people are keen to have their health care covered by insurance. They're not keen on spending a couple hundred dollars for psychiatrists,\" Durbin said. </p>","<p> Access to child psychiatrists are rare across the country, creating a serious issue when teens experience a mental health crisis. To help cut down on the time it can take to find a provider, HEARD put together a vetted list of providers who will take on patients. They also have volunteers, who work with multiple families, to find care for at-risk youth. </p>","<p> She's even had insurance companies call her to confirm that a patient is getting mental health care, Durbin said. </p>","<p> While there have been multiple steps taken to protect students, some groups had other recommendations about how to best help the students. </p>","<p> Teacher Marc Vincenti said he thinks there needs to be an epidemiological study into the suicides and more focus on the root causes for academic stressors. He started the \"Save the 2,008\" initiative, with more than 400 supporters, aimed at helping students in the district. The number 2,008 refers to the number of students at Gunn High School after the string of suicides happened. </p>","<p> The goal is to make sure \"the environment that we send our kids to every day is more humane, is more forgiving, is more compassionate, and is more likely to serve as a safety net to those kids who are especially in despair,\" Vincenti said. </p>","<p> Vincenti said he's concerned that all these new initiatives give students even more work to do, and he wants people to focus on connecting with children and cut down class sizes. </p>","<p> Durbin and Chen both say they hope the community could become an example for others about how to combat a suicide cluster. Durbin pointed out that a tool-kit developed by mental health leaders in Palo Alto, including by members of HEARD, was adopted by across the state. </p>","<p> She said in her own family, one of the new programs has helped her son grapple with the past tragedy. Her oldest son graduated just two days after the first student died by suicide in 2009. </p>","<p> \"He wanted to get out of there,\" she recalled of his graduation. But now with the alumni program, he has reconnected with his old school. </p>","<p> Though suicide clusters can arise anywhere, Gould said a community can take concrete steps to diminish the risk of a cluster and that she has been \"extremely impressed\" by what Palo Alto has done. </p>","<p> \"They have engaged the entire community to embrace their responsibility,\" she told ABC News. \"That is the first thing that is very, very effective.\" </p>","<p> Resources for suicide prevention and mental illness concerns can be found<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/resources-suicide-prevention-mental-illness-concerns-helping-parents/story?id=36712336\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"> here.</a></p>"]},"property":"gma","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":360,"width":640,"ratio":56.00000000000001,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/2zvfvv2cgarvF.mobWN7jA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0xO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/abc_suicide_cluster_04_jc_160216_16x9_992.jpg","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/_EUr2ZHzaBJupYPhwcGrYg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/abc_suicide_cluster_04_jc_160216_16x9_992.jpg","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"663079f1-4dc0-35c8-8b7c-9427abb6b47e","licensed":"true","title":"Top 8 Fun Facts About C.J. the Westminster Kennel Club&#39;s &#39;Best in Show&#39;

Rainier High School seniors have been arrested for allegedly gang-raping two 15-year-old schoolmates, PEOPLE confirms. <br /><br />The girls were allegedly raped while on a three-day overnight school trip in Seattle, Washington, in October 2015. <br /><br />The gang rape took place in a hotel room where chaperones were supposed to be monitoring the students. Four seniors allegedly carried out the gang rape; two of who are over the age of 18. <br /><br />The students were attending a DECA conference with other local high schools. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Keegan J. Tarabochia (also known as Keegan J. Piper) and Donnie Ray Moore, both 18, will bed charged as adults; while the other two suspects (who remain unidentified) will be charged as minors, Dan Donohoe of the Kings County Prosecutors Office tells PEOPLE. <br /><br />According to charging documents obtained by PEOPLE, the two female victims, who were 15 at the time, were allegedly invited to a party in one of the suspect's hotel rooms. <br /><br />When the victims allegedly arrived to the room at around 11:15pm, they found themselves alone with six other male students. The victims, who were in their freshman year of high school at the time, were allegedly offered drinks by two of the males, who were seniors, according to the charging docs. <br /><br />After a drink, both girls said they felt \"totally out of it.\" <br /><br />Each girl began to feel tired and laid down. At one point, one of the victims tried to walk but \"could not keep herself up,\" the charging docs state. <br /><br />After lying down, both victims dozed off before waking up and finding themselves allegedly in bed with one or more of the suspects. <br /><br />The first victim told police that when she came to, one of the suspects who allegedly poured her a drink was allegedly kissing her. She allegedly told him to stop, and pushed him off, but fell back asleep. When she awoke again, his hand was allegedly down her pants. <br /><br />Despite asking him to stop, the suspect allegedly continued while Moore allegedly began sexually abusing her. <br /><br />The victim was then allegedly carried to another bed where Tarabochia allegedly performed oral sex on her against her will. Soon after, Moore and the other suspects allegedly began raping her. <br /><br />The victim told police she kept her eyes closed and felt \"half asleep\" throughout the ordeal. <br /><br />She also said the suspects allegedly \"cycled through me\" multiple times. <br /><br />The victim, who remains unidentified, was a virgin and told police that she cried out in pain while she was raped, the documents state. <br /><br />â¢ <b><em>Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? <a href=\"http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2?a=2&aid=1078530696&n=40&PEOPLE_SOURCE=crime_article\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Click here</a> to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.</em></b><br /><br />The second victim described a similar scene to police. She said that after she had a drink she couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t walk and after sitting on the bed, fell asleep. When she awoke she found herself in the dark with Tarabochia allegedly lying next to her, kissing her. <br /><br />While her memory was foggy, the second victim told police that the suspects also allegedly raped her too. <br /><br />\"No, I'm not ready,\" the second victim allegedly told Tarabochia, however he continued to allegedly sexually abuse her, the charging documents state. <br /><br />Both girls allegedly spent the night in the suspects' rooms, scared to be caught running back to their rooms by chaperones. <br /><br />ÃÂ¬ According to the documents, the second victim told police \"she did not know what to do. She felt like she had to go along with the boys because they were older and she believed that they would have sex with her even if she said now.\" <br /><br />Both girls had never had sex before that night. <br /><br />The next day, after returning to their rooms, the girls attended the scheduled DECA sessions, the documents state. <br /><br />It wasn't until they returned home that they shared their experience with family members who convinced them to report the ordeal to the police, according to the charging documents <br /><br />Two suspects are being charged in juvenile court, while the two older suspects are being charged as adults. <br /><br />All four suspects will be arraigned on Feb, 24, Donohoe tells PEOPLE.</p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"celebrity","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s

For that matter, who wouldnât want to elect âthe greatest jobs president that God ever created,â as Trump has also predicted heâd be?<br>Â <br>It sounds alluring, but is it actually the case that people who proclaim themselves so loudly and so often to be winners actually succeed the most?<br>Â <br>My research into business leaders suggests they donât. On the contrary, it suggests that such bombast is one of a slew of behaviors embraced by spectacularly unsuccessful business executives. Unfortunately, many of these habits are part and parcel of the Trump leadership playbook. Â <br>Â <br>For my book \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Why-Smart-Executives-Fail-Mistakes/dp/1591840457/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Why Smart Executives Fail</a>,\" I interviewed some 200 people at 50 companies to learn why some people in business don't merely lose, but lose big. I discovered an interesting pattern: Spectacularly unsuccessful people tend to display a number of behavior patterns in common. <br>Â <br>One of the most common is a tendency to see themselves and their companies as dominating their industry, regardless of what is happening around them. For example the co-CEOs of Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, failed to appreciate the rise of the iPhone, going so far as to laugh off Appleâs (<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">AAPL</a>) new product as a nonstarter because it didnât have a ârealâ touch keyboard. As weâve seen with Donald Trump, denigrating your competition is one of the best ways to see this syndrome in action. Like Trump, the RIM CEOs felt certain they would win, and it cost them big time. <br><br><strong>Beware the dangers of overconfidence</strong><br>Â <br>Awful executives also tend to think that they have all the answers -- to all the questions. CEO Wolfgang Schmitt drove Rubbermaid into a ditch during the 1990s. A former colleague remembered that under Schmitt, \"the joke went, 'Wolf knows everything about everything.'â Not surprisingly, know-it-all executives suffer because they fail to consider other points of view that might have merit. In fact, no one is always right, yet lousy executives act as if they are. In this regard, Trumpâs impression of his own judgment and intelligence is telling. As he tweeted in May 2013: âSorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest â and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.â In September 2015, he made a similar statement on \"The Tonight Show,\" <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/253465-trump-i-would-apologize-if-i-was-ever-wrong\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">telling host Jimmy Fallon</a>, âI think apologizingâs a great thing, but you have to be wrong. I will absolutely apologize, sometime in the hopefully distant future, if Iâm ever wrong.â <br>Â <br>And then thereâs a related behavior, the tendency to underestimate obstacles. Unsuccessful CEOs are so confident that they blithely wave away the challenges that might impede them from realizing their visions. When these challenges materialize, do they backtrack? No! They double down and get in even deeper.<br><br>In announcing his run for president, Trump proclaimed that he would solve the immigration issue by building a wall along the Mexican border: âI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.â Yet by most estimates, the cost of fencing in all 2,000 miles of border would be expensive, perhaps as high as $25 billion. Trump has talked about building a wall, not a fence, which would push the cost even higher. As for Mexico footing the bill, a spokesman for Mexicoâs president has scoffed at the idea, noting that it \"reflects an enormous ignorance for what Mexico represents, and also the irresponsibility of the candidate who's saying it.\" <br>Â <br>But hasnât Trump actually been very successful â isn't he a billionaire? Leaving aside the four bankruptcies, mostly due to problems at his Atlantic City casinos, thereâs no question that his <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-net-worth-forbes-214204\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">net worth </a>today is in the billions. While no one can predict with certainty whether his business empire will remain intact in the years to come, CEOs who embrace unsuccessful habits, as Trump does, are particularly vulnerable to a downturn. Itâs almost like thereâs a geological fault line beneath the surface, ready to erupt when the pressure becomes too unbearable. In my research, triggers like a major business slump, a huge acquisition, and a strong new competitor were all responsible for turning seemingly thriving companies into disasters in record time. Stress points typically bring out the worst in spectacularly unsuccessful leaders; habits that didnât foul them up in better times can become fatal. <br>Â <br><strong>Not the smartest guy in the room</strong><br><br>What might trigger those fault lines under a President Trump? Where to begin? Anything from a global crisis for which he lacks both personal experience and the makeup to be schooled by experts who may well have a different take than that of the intuitive deal maker who insists that heâs the smartest guy in the room; to even new economic crises that canât be resolved with bluster. <br>Â <br>Other research I have conducted raises still more concerns. In writing my current book \"<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-to-tell-if-you-work-for-a-superboss-182026726.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Superbosses</a>,\" I turned the tables and explored why some executives succeeded more fabulously than others. In particular, I spent 10 years investigating the secrets of leaders who not only amassed great wealth, but who developed a generation of leaders in their industries. Here again I managed to identify a number of behaviors these leaders had in common, including the willingness to share the spotlight with subordinates, to work closely with protÃ©gÃ©s and learn from them, and to hang back and give employees room to make their own decisions. <br>Â <br>Trumpâs answer to a moderatorâs question in the most recent Republican candidate debate in South Carolina was telling:<br>Â <br>Question: Can you tell us of an instance where somebody has said, âDonald Trump, youâre wrong,â and you listened to them?<br>Â <br>Answer: Well, I would say my wife tells me Iâm wrong all the time. And I listen. <br>Â <br>Question: About what?<br>Â <br>Answer: Oh, let me just say â look, I am very open â I hired top people. Iâve had great success. I built a great, great company. I donât need to do this.<br>Â <br>Superbosses have big egos, but the one thing they still do is make room for other people â their opinions, their ideas, and their influence. Thatâs how great organizations stay great. Trump not only appears to have a different leadership mindset, he also seems oblivious to the risks that often come with unadulterated egos.<br>Â <br>These are all questions that cry out for more considered analysis by the press and the electorate alike. There is little weâve seen about candidate Trump to ease these concerns. Predicting leadership behavior on the basis of past leadership behavior is smart, but not foolproof. But at a minimum, Trumpâs adherence to key habits of spectacularly unsuccessful executives should be a warning sign. Does this mean that a President Trump will necessarily fall prey to the same weaknesses that have brought down previously successful leaders like Ken Lay of Enron, Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco, and Martin Winterkorn of Volkswagen?

This is not hosting a talk show, or a reality show. Itâs not promotion; itâs not marketing,â the president continued when asked about Trumpâs odds during a news conference in Rancho Mirage, CA,Â where he is attending a summit with leaders of 10 southeast Asian countries.</p>","<p>âItâs hard,â Obama continued. âItâs not pandering â doing whatever will get you in the news that day. â¦ Itâs doing things that are unpopular, and standing up for people who are vulnerable.â The office, Obama continued pointedly, ârequires working with leaders around the world in a way that reflects the importance of the office and gives people confidence that you know the facts, and you know their name, and you know where they are on a map, and know something about their history, and do not just play to the crowd back home â because [those foreign leaders] have their own crowds back home and youâre trying to solve problems.â</p>","<p>Continuing his scorched-earth Trump ding, Obama chided the media for, so far, having covered the race âjust like entertainment.â</p>","<p>âBut as you get closer [to election day], the reality of it has a way of introducing itself,â Obama promised. Ultimately, he predicted, American voters will remember âthe person who will be standing where I am nowâ has the nuclear codes, can send 21-year-olds into battle, are charged with making sure the banking system doesnât collapse, and will be the person 20 other countries with big problems will look to for look solutions. The American people are pretty sensible, and I think they will make a sensible choice in the end.â</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>In fairness, Obama said Trump is just a more colorfully packaged version of ideas other GOP candidates are espousing.</p>","<p>Of the other candidates, Obama said: âYouâve got a candidate that sponsored a bill I supported to finally solve our immigration problem and heâs running away from it as fast as he can.Â They all deny climate change. I think thatâs troubling to the international community. They count on the United States being on the side of science and reason, and common sense. They know if United States does not act on big problems in smart ways, nobody will. This not just Mr. Trump.â</p>","<p>Not long thereafter, TrumpÂ wasÂ sitting down with the former chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party at a campaign stop in that state and was asked to respond to Obamaâs comment. âThis man has done such a bad job,â Trump said, ticking off all the ways in which he felt Obamaâs administration had failed. âObamacare is terrible,â âthe border is Swiss cheese,â âheâs set us back so far,â etc. â and concluded â âfor him to say that is a compliment.â For good measure, Trump said directly to Obama, âYouâre lucky I didnât run last time, when Romney ran, because you would have been a one-term president.â Moving past that withering âmight have beenâ thought, Trump promised: âWeâre going to do it. â¦ Weâre going to win. Weâre going to Make America Great Again,â he said, reverting to theme.</p>","<p>Trump now holds a 16 point lead in South Carolina over closest GOP candidate, Ted Cruz, four days before that stateâs primary.</p>","<div>\n <div>\n  Related stories\n </div>\n <div>\n  <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/02/jimmy-fallon-donald-trump-fuller-house-video-1201704120/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">'Fuller House' Cast Urges Donald Trump To Make America Great Again</a>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/02/donald-trump-swear-jar-stephen-colbert-video-1201704016/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Donald Trump, Mistreated By Media, Agrees To Swear Jar On Stephen Colbert's Show Ahead Of MSNBC Town Hall</a>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/02/supreme-court-obama-nominee-gop-threat-1201703571/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Obama Vows To Nominate Supreme Court Justice Despite GOP Threats</a>\n </div>\n</div>","<p><strong><u>Get more from Deadline.com</u></strong>: Follow us on <a href=\"https://bitly.com/1fz7Oji\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"><u>Twitter</u></a>, <a href=\"http://on.fb.me/MifyrT\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"><u>Facebook</u></a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1BdD1TM\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"><u>Newsletter</u></a></p>"]},"property":"tv","images":[{"caption":"Donald Trump will not be the next President of the United States, current POTUS Barack Obama forecast this afternoon, when asked.\n&#8220;I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president, and the reason is because I have a lot of faith in Americans,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;I think they recognize being president is a serious job.

href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/885b2bf0-d499-11e5-8887-98e7feb46f27.html#axzz40MEZ2ObC\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">calling on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg</a> to bail him out. (It's unclear whether his \"debts\" are tied to a lavish lifestyle or simply an estimate of the money he has <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/02/15/kanye-west-debt-53-million-investment/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">sunk into various business ventures</a>.) But while $53 million is certainly an eye-popping sum, it's not necessarily all that out of the ordinary, considering how much West makes.</p>","<p>While the numbers can be a little squishy, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/kanye-west-probably-isnt-in-us53-million-debt-20160215-gmuwmn.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">reports put</a> West's income at $22 million in 2015 and $30 million the year before that. So while $53 million seems like a lot of debt, it's only a hair above what he earned over the past two years.</p>","<p><strong><em>Read next: <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4226174/kill-100-dollar-bill-500-euro-phase-out/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Why $100 Bills and â¬500 Notes May Soon Be Killed Off</a></em></strong></p>","<p>If you have a mortgage or student loans, a debt load that amounts to twice your income probably doesn't seem too shocking. Indeed, a 2015 study by <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2015/07/the-complex-story-of-american-debt\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">The Pew Charitiable Trust</a> found that the average Gen Xerâthe 38-year-old West's age cohortâhad median debt of $80,000, including a mortgage, on an income of $68,000. The top third of debtors owed a median of $251,000 on an income of $113,000.</p>","<p>Of course, it's difficult to be sure just how heavy West's debt burden is without knowing anything about the interest rate he is paying on borrowed money or how long he has to repay it. But let's try to put it in a bit of context. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau suggests it's smart to keep your monthly debt payments below <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/1791/what-debt-income-ratio-why-43-debt-income-ratio-important.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">43% of your annual income</a>, the threshold that allows you to qualify for a government-backed mortgage. While that's not likely to be a specific concern of West's, the ratio was picked because it's reasonable threshold for financial health.</p>","<p><em><strong>Read next: <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4225849/how-to-stream-kanye-wests-life-of-pablo-for-free/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">How to Stream Kanye West's 'Life of Pablo' for Free</a></strong></em></p>","<p>If West's debts resemble a mortgage, secured by valuable property with a low fixed-interest rate of, say, <a href=\"https://www.onewestbank.com/jumbo-loans/super-jumbo-loan/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">4% and a long 30-year term</a>, his annual payments would amount to an easy $3 million a year, according to Google's mortgage calculator. Amounting to less than 15% of West's income, that kind of debt load shouldn't lead anyone to shed tears for him.</p>","<p>On the other hand, if the debts are more like credit card loans, with a hefty <a href=\"http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/interest-rate-report-100114-up-2121.php\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">15% interest rate</a>, paying off $53 million might stingâup to a point. <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/debtrepayment\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">According to the calculator at CreditKarma.com</a>, annual payments to eliminate a $53 million debt over 10 years at those lofty double-digit rates would amount to about $11 million a year.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Even in that worst-case scenario, however, West doesn't exactly appear to be drowning in red ink. That $11 million is about half his earnings last year, but only 36% of what he made in 2014.</p>","<p><em><strong>Read next: <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4225485/kanye-west-tidal-life-of-pablo-money/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">How Much Money Kanye West Will Lost Streaming 'Life of Pablo' on Tidal</a></strong></em></p>","<p>West does face one issue most of us working stiffs jobs don't. While we expect regular paychecks for 30 years or more, West probably can't count on earning at 2014 and 2015 levels for years to come. As it happens he won't be the first pop star to wrestle with this problem either.</p>","<p>If West wants to pay down the debt early, he could try a move pioneered by the late, great David Bowie. So-called Bowie bonds, which he sold in 1997, allowed investors to collect future revenues from Bowie's song catalog in exchange for an upfront payment. As it happened, <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4175086/david-bowie-bond-royalties-securitized/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Bowie raised $55 million</a>. That would be just enough to leave Kanye debt free.</p>"]},"property":"finance","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":427,"width":640,"ratio":67,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/4uybj1Uh44n8CZsuMKrETw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/money_403/12d5705c7e1ea97b474d392c74191231","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/ZPNF6XLiPIdz04zAyXkZ1A--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/money_403/12d5705c7e1ea97b474d392c74191231","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[],"count":0},{"type":"slideshow","is_eligible":"true","id":"867e7224-552c-3ad8-bc55-7c28d12c12e2","licensed":"true","title":"15 Things You Should Never Buy at the Grocery Store","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/photos/15-things-never-buy-grocery-215044383/","categories":"YCT:001000123","publisher":"Woman&#39;s Day","provider_logo":"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"83716191","propertyRegion":"YPROP:health","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"83716191","site_attribute":"rs=\"lmsid:a0ad000000BfCPXAA3;revsp:woman_s_day_132;lpstaid:867e7224-552c-3ad8-bc55-7c28d12c12e2\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"count":"15","total":"15","description":"Commit these money pits to memory and never be swindled again.Â ââ","hosted":true,"publicationDate":"19 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo - ABC News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000123","score":"0.7","label":"Business"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["\nCommit these money pits to memory and never be swindled again.Â ââ"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"health","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":427,"width":640,"ratio":67,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/6kveKXpNQHhFU6rm104MmQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/woman_s_day_132/9226fba92025b5ff114cd018ddba0289","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/gZpYAqP2F3MwztOn98_dVw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/woman_s_day_132/9226fba92025b5ff114cd018ddba0289","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[{"caption":"<p>&quot;Skip the apple slices and do the food prep yourself,&quot; Jeanette Pavini, savings expert for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.coupons.com/\">Coupons.com</a>. &quot;Even things like lettuce can be a lot less expensive if you wash it yourself.&quot;<br></p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.womansday.com/life/work-money/g2168/things-you-should-never-buy-at-the-grocery-store/\">From Woman&#39;s Day</a></p>","id":"78ba1054-4bd5-3e5a-a9c5-2408b4f41125","title":"<p>&quot;Skip the apple slices and do the food prep yourself,&quot; Jeanette Pavini, savings expert for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.coupons.com/\">Coupons.com</a>. &quot;Even things like lettuce can be a lot less expensive if you wash it yourself.&quot;<br></p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.womansday.com/life/work-money/g2168/things-you-should-never-buy-at-the-grocery-store/\">From Woman&#39;s Day</a></p>","type":"photo","shortCaption":"&quot;Skip the apple slices and do the food prep yourself,&quot; Jeanette Pavini, savings expert for Coupons.com. &quot;Even things like lettuce can be a lot less expensive if you wash it yourself.&quot;  From Woman&#39;s Day ","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/f5T.O4SoawMzFOLrjQqZFg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/woman_s_day_132/9226fba92025b5ff114cd018ddba0289","alt":"1) Pre-Cut Veggies and Fruits"},"index":1},{"caption":"<p>The confections at your grocer&#39;s bakery feature markups of up to 300% in some cases, according to Kendel Perez, savings expert for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.couponsherpa.com/\">CouponSherpa.com</a>.

Iran's stance will complicate talks on output levels after a surprise compromise this week between two of the world's top exporters - non-OPEC Russia and the group's leader Saudi Arabia - to freeze output at January levels, near their historic highs. The first mooted global oil pact in 15 years has so far failed to impress the market, which had expected a production cut instead of a freeze that could even turn into an increase if Iran wins special terms from fellow OPEC members.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PHAYDcKJTtLZ.yF7feoUxQ--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cbstv/4/2/503f5ec5-a8e4-4054-b2ea-790dec0f4a81_0SLbtZomX8C-GOfyn-H-ctbf_NnWXrR8UDDH3RrhllCzqLCL86M9BVpRlD-8Z4zKJ64nebSy5rI-_2_0.jpg?s=778298411d5f8b36b252b52f9361bfce&c=5f8487b9efaf2345e0c4a3f9692580cc&a=cbstv&mr=0","tag":"size=original","width":"640","height":"360"}},{"followId":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","name":"NBA trade deadline","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"1da1d75e-46da-36a5-9c21-37fe34287d9a","cluster_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Guide to the NBA trade deadline: Jazz","link":"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/guide-to-the-nba-trade-deadline--jazz-060619872.html","image_assets":[{"width":"3000","height":"2199","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HLpQRlX6aNyehpmdxCw4PA--/aD0yMTk5O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1051072435.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qUUYQm8nN8AS5KxqpSi2Xg--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1051072435.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kw_BnmFL89QkVxWRFbVDMQ--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1051072435.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-17T16:50:56Z","summary":"Utah needs help at point guard and has cap room to absorb a contract.","publisher":"Yahoo Sports"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GDPZcnx8ZCiCIc8Pz3nYIA--/aD0yNjU4O3c9MzU3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2016-01-07/7284f280-b4f9-11e5-a866-1bb04099a352_AP_865358000156.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"3576","height":"2658"}},{"followId":"f38c1ffa-cbfd-11e5-a07a-fa163e2c24a6","name":"Pope Francis","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"668becd6-1125-32f7-b7c4-a1847a22b44b","cluster_id":"f38c1ffa-cbfd-11e5-a07a-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Pope's flash of anger in crowd 'human': Vatican","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/popes-flash-anger-crowd-human-vatican-155242982.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1024","height":"576","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FgQi2ZVBnDtcgyLgsjkNpg--/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-620208080.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LPJ.3kYzESyvwtj1bVMb1w--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-620208080.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4lzwTilEarhayiT8iHwryg--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-620208080.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-17T16:47:48Z","summary":"The Vatican defended Pope Francis's \"human reaction\" after he briefly lost his temper when an over-enthusiastic admirer in Mexico tugged him over on top of a child in a wheelchair.

The investigation is being led by the Tainan District Prosecutors Office.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j15UEBGPjv9NNX3TC6OsXA--/aD0xMzY1O3c9MjA0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/2fdc738ae2a5be068f0f6a7067009f4c.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"2047","height":"1365"}},{"followId":"72747640-bbce-11e5-9751-fa163e2c24a6","name":"Stock market falls","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"a7427ea0-1511-37c6-bf29-4ed698dbf02b","cluster_id":"72747640-bbce-11e5-9751-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Stocks end off lows as energy stocks eke out gains","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-open-sharply-lower-oil-143000759.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1910","height":"1000","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B.SILknyUAOmt34udqnaCw--/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTkxMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--951305653.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/apio_mbmDxHWVLFqVxdbhw--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--951305653.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2_cw9..BAmAPi_XhTCUlSw--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--951305653.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-09T05:45:52Z","summary":"U.S. stocks closed off their session lows on Monday amid a late rally in the energy sector.","publisher":"CNBC"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/riNOG3U_iIIWFFC9b2ECTw--/aD0zNjA7dz02Mzk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/xNUv7tDHrLzu0YLYEvWt2w--/YXBwaWQ9eXZpZGVvZmVlZHM7aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7Zmk9ZmlsbA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@76e77b0b-300a-33fe-9fd2-76aa58afd72f_FULL.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"639","height":"360"}},{"followId":"c4937a5e-5e52-11e5-b600-fa163e2c24a6","name":"NFL concussions","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"416d8c06-d4e6-3b1a-aafe-2433a17ec195","cluster_id":"c4937a5e-5e52-11e5-b600-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Concussions May Increase Suicide Risk, Study Finds","link":"https://gma.yahoo.com/concussions-may-increase-suicide-risk-study-finds-204558968.html","image_assets":[{"width":"992","height":"559","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_81dSkY401iu7yYHcSOGMw--/aD01NTk7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1546244556.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2EXImUyPHP6WPLLfwTkpKQ--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1546244556.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Nzso.2dwrbHmqDAIXjr4AQ--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1546244556.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-09T01:29:38Z","summary":"The risks of suffering a concussion have been under the spotlight in recent years, especially as the degenerative neurological illness known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has been found in multiple football players after their deaths.
