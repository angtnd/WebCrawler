Mr. Hollande said. &#8220;We are in a war against jihadist terrorism, which threatens the entire world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Mr. Hollande listed some of the names of the victims of the attacks on Friday, noting that many were under the age of 30. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">&#8220;What was their only crime? That they were alive.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The attacks were planned in Syria, organized in Belgium and carried out with the complicity of French citizens, Mr. Hollande said, noting the terrorists attacked France for its role in &#8220;fighting against terrorism in the Middle East.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The French president listed the sites of other deadly attacks carried out by ISIS this year, including Denmark, Tunisia, Lebanon, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Libya, in addition to &#8220;daily&#8221; massacres in Syria and Iraq.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">&#8220;That is why the necessity to destroy Daesh is an issue that concerns all of the international community,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have therefore asked the Security Council to convene as quickly as possible to adopt a resolution demonstrating this common will to fight against terrorism.&#8221;<\/p>\n","highlight":false,"homepage":false,"standalone":true,"share_image":"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/11\/17\/world\/blog-hollande\/blog-hollande-facebookJumbo.jpg","homepage_title":"","dateline":"PARIS","selected_tags":[],"tags":[],"locked":0},{"ID":7860,"title":"Israel Responds to Remark by Sweden&#8217;s Foreign Minister on Radicalization and Paris","status":"publish","type":"nyt_live_update","author":{"ID":98,"username":"craig.allen","name":"Craig Allen","first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Allen","nickname":"craig.allen","slug":"craigallen","URL":"http:\/\/","avatar":"","description":"","registered":"2008-08-26T22:51:12-04:00"},"content":"[nytmedia id=\"100000004040121\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nIsrael summoned the Swedish ambassador there to its foreign ministry on Monday to clarify his foreign minister\u2019s remarks suggesting that Palestinian hopelessness was connected to the terrorism that struck Paris. \n\nEmmanuel Nahshon, Israel\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, called the comments by Margaret Wallstrom, Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, \u201cappallingly impudent\u201d and accused her of being \u201cconsistently biased against Israel.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhoever fatuously attempts to create a link between radical Islamist attacks and the current situation between Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d Mr. Nahshon said in a statement, \u201cis fooling himself, his people and international public opinion.\u201d\n\nMs. Wallstrom, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tobiassjd\/videos\/10154524045168018\/\">weekend interview on Swedish public television<\/a>, mentioned the Palestinians as an example when discussing root causes of radicalization. \n\n\u201cTo counteract the radicalization, we must go back to the situation, such as the one in the Middle East of which not the least the Palestinians see that there is not future,\u201d she said, according to a translation by the news site Times of Israel. \u201cWe must either accept a desperate situation or resort to violence.\u201d\n\nAn American-born Swede living in Israel, David Metzler, wrote about the remarks in a blog post on the news site on Sunday, calling them foolish, severe, irresponsible and mind-boggling.

Brennan, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said on Monday morning that the Paris attacks and the recent downing of a Russian jet over the Sinai Peninsula both bear the \u201challmarks\u201d of the Islamic State.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">He said that the group, which he called an \u201cassociation of murderous sociopaths,\u201d had been developing an \u201cexternal operations agenda\u201d that it has begun to implement \u201cwith lethal effect.\u201d Mr. Brennan also said he believed that the Islamic State had more terrorist plots against the West in the works, and that it is determined to carry out what he called the group\u2019s \u201cexternal agenda.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The Islamic State, he said during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, is \u201cnot going to content itself with violence inside the Syrian and Iraqi borders.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Wading into the debate over surveillance, privacy and encrypted communications, the C.I.A. director said he hoped that the Paris attacks might be a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Europe and the United States during a time of criticism over expansive surveillance programs. He said that \u201cunauthorized disclosures\u201d [read: Edward J. Snowden] and \u201chand-wringing\u201d over the government\u2019s role in disrupting terrorism have weakened the abilities of Western intelligence services to prevent attacks from groups like the Islamic State.<\/p>\n","highlight":false,"homepage":false,"standalone":true,"share_image":"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/11\/17\/world\/17Blog-Brennan\/17Blog-Brennan-facebookJumbo.jpg","homepage_title":"","dateline":"WASHINGTON","selected_tags":[],"tags":[],"locked":0}]
