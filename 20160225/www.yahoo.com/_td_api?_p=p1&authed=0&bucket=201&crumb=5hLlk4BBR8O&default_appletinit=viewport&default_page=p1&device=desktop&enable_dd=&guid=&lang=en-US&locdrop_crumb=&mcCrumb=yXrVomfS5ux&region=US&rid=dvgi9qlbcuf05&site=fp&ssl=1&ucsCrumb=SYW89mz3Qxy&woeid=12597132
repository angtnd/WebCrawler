The investigation is being led by the Tainan District Prosecutors Office.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j15UEBGPjv9NNX3TC6OsXA--/aD0xMzY1O3c9MjA0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/2fdc738ae2a5be068f0f6a7067009f4c.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"2047","height":"1365"}},{"followId":"72747640-bbce-11e5-9751-fa163e2c24a6","name":"Stock market falls","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"a7427ea0-1511-37c6-bf29-4ed698dbf02b","cluster_id":"72747640-bbce-11e5-9751-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Stocks end off lows as energy stocks eke out gains","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-open-sharply-lower-oil-143000759.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1910","height":"1000","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B.SILknyUAOmt34udqnaCw--/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTkxMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--951305653.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/apio_mbmDxHWVLFqVxdbhw--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--951305653.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2_cw9..BAmAPi_XhTCUlSw--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--951305653.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-09T05:45:52Z","summary":"U.S. stocks closed off their session lows on Monday amid a late rally in the energy sector.","publisher":"CNBC"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/riNOG3U_iIIWFFC9b2ECTw--/aD0zNjA7dz02Mzk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/xNUv7tDHrLzu0YLYEvWt2w--/YXBwaWQ9eXZpZGVvZmVlZHM7aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7Zmk9ZmlsbA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@76e77b0b-300a-33fe-9fd2-76aa58afd72f_FULL.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"639","height":"360"}},{"followId":"c4937a5e-5e52-11e5-b600-fa163e2c24a6","name":"NFL concussions","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"416d8c06-d4e6-3b1a-aafe-2433a17ec195","cluster_id":"c4937a5e-5e52-11e5-b600-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Concussions May Increase Suicide Risk, Study Finds","link":"https://gma.yahoo.com/concussions-may-increase-suicide-risk-study-finds-204558968.html","image_assets":[{"width":"992","height":"559","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_81dSkY401iu7yYHcSOGMw--/aD01NTk7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1546244556.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2EXImUyPHP6WPLLfwTkpKQ--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1546244556.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Nzso.2dwrbHmqDAIXjr4AQ--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1546244556.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-09T01:29:38Z","summary":"The risks of suffering a concussion have been under the spotlight in recent years, especially as the degenerative neurological illness known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has been found in multiple football players after their deaths.

Which wasnât me.</p>","\n<!-- more -->","<p><i>Full House</i> in its original incarnation was the cornerstone of ABCâs âTGIFâ schedule of child-friendly shows that included <i>Family Matters</i> and <i>Perfect Strangers</i>. This was at a time when there were fewer prime-time network or cable kid options, and when parents still spent time watching what their offspring were consuming. (Do they still have time to do that?) As such, <i>Full House </i>â a show about three goofy guys overseeing a batch of tykes, learning how to parent on-the-job âÂ fit the bill just fine.</p>","<p><b><i>Related: <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/tv/see-fuller-house-season-1-180341479.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">SeeÂ âFuller Houseâ Season 1 Photos</a></i></b></p>","<p>The new <i>Fuller House</i> is overseen by the originalâs creator, Jeff Franklin, and he is wise to have stuck to the originalâs mood. Which must have been a challenge: After all, stars Bob Saget, John Stamos, Dave Coulier, and Lori Loughlin arenât going to be in every episode â Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/fuller-house-mary-kate-ashley-olsen-missing-john-stamos-dave-coulier\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">turned down the project flatly</a> â and so <i>Fuller</i> is built around the supporting cast.</p>","<p>Thus, Candace Cameron Bure (as D.J.), Jodie Sweetin (as Stephanie), and Andrea Barber (as Kimmy Gibbler) are the stars of this show, along with a passel of new kids to take care of. The pilot episode plays heavily on nostalgia, with the originalâs set faithfully reproduced. Saget, Stamos, Coulier, and Loughlin all appear to tee things up for the rest of the run before beating a hasty retreat. <br /></p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXuGLswn2l0?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>"],"remaining_body":["<p>The opening episode acknowledges the current era in glancing ways, such as having one of the little kids say that Donald Trump is âa bad word.â The studio audience was primed to supply the <i>oooh</i>s, the <i>aaaah</i>s, and the <i>aaaawww</i>s at the sentimental moments, and Coulier gets a hearty round of applause for saying, one more time, âCut it out!â</p>","<p>In subsequent episodes, the big names fade away â Stamos, an executive producer on this project, makes a welcome cameo in the second episode, for example, but heâs there for just a few minutes. Of the other performers, Barber is a hopeless ham, mugging for the camera even more strenuously than she did when she was young Kimmy. By contrast, Soni Bringas, as her daughter Ramona, is probably the most adroit of the new kid characters, delivering her punchlines with smooth timing.Â </p>","<p>No one is ever going to say <i>Fuller House</i> is great TV, but as a nostalgia item, it will probably amuse its original, now grown, audience for an episode or two. The question is whether todayâs children will find this genial cornball production diverting enough to keep them tapping their tablets for more Netflix episodes â that is by no means a sure bet.</p>","<p><b><i>Fuller House </i>starts streaming Friday on Netflix. </b></p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://tv.yahoo.com/video/john-stamos-talks-fuller-house-130000622.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>"]},"property":"tv","images":[{"caption":"&#39;Fuller House&#39;: What Happens When Nostalgia Gets A Reboot","id":"6404ea70-7d79-35fc-a569-87480efd30bb","title":"&#39;Fuller House&#39;: What Happens When Nostalgia Gets A Reboot","type":"photo","shortCaption":"&#39;Fuller House&#39;: What Happens When Nostalgia Gets A Reboot","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/0ybo_762Zx0atWrR40LZLg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/6669252151b3096cf52e5fe61b6de5bc","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"This image released by Netflix shows, from left, Andrea Barber, Jodie Sweetin, and Candace Cameron Bure in a scene from, &quot;Fuller House,&quot; streaming on Netflix beginning on Friday, Feb. 26.

As he strode toward midcourt, the schoolâs blue blob mascot bounded up to congratulate him.</p>","<p>Mack shook the blobâs furry hand. All business. Not a smile on his face.</p>","<p>Then he took a few more steps and at last broke into a wide grin. Here came the two-girl court storm.</p>","<p>Daughters Lainee (10 years old) and Hailee (9) were the only fans to make it onto the floor, in direct disobedience to the P.A. announcerâs repeated pleas for Xavier backers to stay in their seats after <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaab/villanova-wildcats-xavier-musketeers-201602240682/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">beating Villanova, 90-83</a>.</p>","<p>âGonna ground them,â their dad said afterward, smiling. Later he joked, âI know when theyâre 13 or 14 theyâll just text me, âCongrats.â â</p>","<p>Congratulations, via text or hug, were certainly in order. This was one of the biggest nights in program history. If Chris Mack and Xavier can finally beat Villanova, they might be able to beat anybody.</p>","<p>Since joining the Big East in 2013, the Musketeers were 0-6 against the Wildcats. Most of those losses were beatdowns. Average margin of defeat: 17 points. The road to the Big East title has gone through Philly, and that road has been closed to Xavier.</p>","<p>The most recent meeting was a 31-point bloodletting on Dec. 31. Xavier mix-master Edmond Sumner had suffered a scary injury just two minutes into that game, throwing the team out of kilter, but the bottom line couldnât be excused away: Nova was way better than Xavier. Again.</p>","<p>âIâve been here for every loss to Villanova since weâve been in the Big East,â junior guard Myles Davis said. âSo itâs weighed on me.â</p>","<p>Heading into this Wednesday showdown â <a href=\" http://sports.yahoo.com/news/why-villanova-xavier-clash-is-historically--religiously-relevant-032641954-ncaab.html \" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">the first meeting of top-five Catholic schools in 31 years</a>, each with their highest AP ranking ever â the No. 5 Musketeers heard about Villanovaâs mastery of them endlessly.

But thereâs a reason we havenât beaten them.

Or something like that. And there is little reason to think the deep, athletic, balanced, relentless Musketeers arenât capable of looking the biggest and best teams squarely in the eye.</p>","<p>Itâs a wide-open season â guys named Karl Anthony-Towns, Jahlil Okafor and Frank Kaminsky arenât around anymore, and nobody has adequately taken their place. Consistency is elusive, especially at the top â Villanova is the sixth AP No. 1 of the season, and we may well have another new one next week. So why not Xavier?</p>","<p>The only knock is the fact that it has never been that far before, and experience (especially for the coach) tends to be a strong predictor of national championship success. Of the 16 titles won this century, only two were captured by coaches appearing in their first Final Four (Bill Self in 2008, Kevin Ollie in â14).</p>","<p>But the 46-year-old Mack may have what it takes to do it on his first try if Xavier gets that far. In his seventh season, he has constructed a roster of wonderfully complementary parts.</p>","<p>The best players are young: the spectacularly athletic Sumner, who had 19 points, nine assists and six rebounds, is a redshirt freshman; leading scorer Trevon Blueitt is a sophomore; so is bench energizer J.P. Macura, who dropped 19 on âNova. Seniors scored just 10 of Xavierâs 90 on Wednesday night.</p>","<p>They are willing to share the ball and the spotlight, even in the biggest game of their college careers: Blueitt, who is averaging 15 points per game, attempted just seven shots against the Wildcats. The Musketeers had 24 assists on 30 baskets.</p>","<p>âI truly believe we have a special passing team,â Mack said.</p>","<p>Mack and his staff arenât out battling Kentucky and Duke for players. Theyâre mostly mining the Midwest, grabbing guys with more upside than ready-made, five-star ability. Then they make them better.</p>","<p>âWe identified some talented players we felt wanted to get better,â Mack said. âWe pride ourselves on developing our players.â</p>","<p>Between 6-10 Jalen Reynolds, 6-10 James Farr and 6-8 Kaiser Gates, Xavier should have enough size to battle the big boys â especially when buttressed by a trio of 6-5 and 6-6 wing players. There are ball handlers. Distributors. Shooters. Defenders. And a leading man in Blueitt.</p>","<p>But Sumner is particularly intriguing. He came out of high school in Detroit as a rail-thin, 6-foot-3 guard. Now heâs a rail-thin, 6-6 combo player, capable of fracturing a defense off the dribble and in transition. Shot selection and shooting mechanics can still be an issue, but there arenât many college defenders who can stay in front of him â and thatâs after overcoming patellar tendinitis in his knees that shut down his 2014-15 season after just six games.</p>","<p>The Xavier that was routed by Villanova earlier this season without Sumner looked a lot different than the Xavier the Wildcats saw Wednesday night.</p>","<p>âHe made a big difference,â Nova coach Jay Wright said. âHeâs a hell of a player.â</p>","<p>As Sumner continues to flourish, he might be the X-factor who catapults X into a higher realm than itâs ever experienced.</p>","<p>âI think we have bigger fish to fry,â Mack said. âIf we continue to get better, the skyâs the limit.â</p>","<p>Or the roof. Whatever phrase works for you.</p>","<p>But Mack is right: Catholic schools love a good fish fry, and Xavier may be able to schedule the biggest one in its history.</p>","<p>Tentative date: April 2, in Houston.</p>","<p><div class=\"Mb-20\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248776007&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" style=\"width:100%;height:166\"></iframe></div></p>"]},"property":"sports","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"b93397e7-294c-3f20-a7fa-3ddf2175bf1a","licensed":"true","title":"Monster Waves Slam Hawaii, Damaging Oceanfront Homes","link":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/monster-swells-slam-hawaii_us_56ce50b8e4b0871f60ea185b?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592","summary":"Every so often, Mother Nature shows off her raw and unforgiving power.In Hawaii, that force has been on display all week, thanks toÂ a pair of gigantic, back-to-back swells, which generated waves large enough to overtake beach parks, wash across roadways and damage oceanfront properties.&quot;We&#39;re","entities":"WIKIID:Hawaii","categories":"YCT:001000655","publisher":"Huffington Post","author":"Chris DAngelo","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"","provider_url":"http://huffingtonpost.com","site":"frontpage","region":"us","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"1197762606","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"1197762606","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Hawaii;Mother_Nature\" rs=\"lmsid:a0Vd0000003rEIvEAM;revsp:huffingtonpost.com.rss;lpstaid:b93397e7-294c-3f20-a7fa-3ddf2175bf1a\"","site":"offnetwork","region":"us","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":false,"publicationDate":"6 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000655","score":"0.7","label":"Natural Phenomena"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>Every so often, Mother Nature shows off her raw and unforgiving power.In Hawaii, that force has been on display all week, thanks toÂ a pair of gigantic, back-to-back swells, which generated waves large enough to overtake beach parks, wash across roadways and damage oceanfront properties.\"We're seeing very, very huge wave heights,\" Honolulu...</p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"news"},{"type":"video","is_eligible":"true","id":"fd867f4c-d1d2-3dd3-8731-13e5283a2c48","title":"Coast Guard ship flips while trying to rescue fishing boat off Rockaway Beach","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/video/coast-guard-ship-flips-while-110841249.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1280","height":"720","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MoiCnSabFWPE_242nEClhA--/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.wabc.abc.news.com/0d55851f145501e318873c014777cf15","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"640","height":"360","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VnhxCs3U.gYlF3zYdAr0fA--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.wabc.abc.news.com/0d55851f145501e318873c014777cf15","tag":"img:640x?"}],"summary":"A fishing boat ran aground off Rockaway Beach in Queens, and a Coast Guard vessel, then sent to rescue them, overturned.","entities":"WIKIID:Fishing_vessel","categories":"YCT:001000992|YCT:001001027","publisher":"WABC â NY","provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/1uF2nI8w8R6F98kPM7VUtw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://l.yimg.com/os/152/2012/10/25/wabc44x70-png_145514.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/index","site":"news","region":"us","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"84397933","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"84397933","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Fishing_vessel\" ctopid=\"1106000;1107000\" hashtag=\"1106000;1107000\" rs=\"lmsid:a097000000VKQUWAA5;revsp:video.wabc.abc.news.com;lpstaid:fd867f4c-d1d2-3dd3-8731-13e5283a2c48\"","site":"news","region":"us","lang":"en-US"},"duration":"0:05:40","hosted":true,"publicationDate":"5 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo -

No. 1 with Hispanics,\" he said. \"I'm really happy about that.\"</span></p> <p>But there are some pretty major caveats to this result. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2016/02/25/poll-trumps-negatives-among-hispanics-rise-worst-in-gop-field/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">new poll out Wednesday</a> found that Trump is viewed most negatively by Hispanic voters of any Republican hopeful.</p> <p>And second, entrance polling is based on taking a small sample of caucusgoers, ideally at random, and asking them about their demographic identities, political affiliations, and â most importantly â who they support in the caucus.</p> <p>Entrance and exit polls tend to do a decent job of giving us an overall picture of who participated in a caucus or an election. And they can sometimes (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22188-2005Jan19.html?nav=rss_politics/elections/2004\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">but not always</a>) give an early clue as to the results of that caucus or election.</p> <p>But they also often run into difficulties in discerning the behavior of smaller subgroups.</p> <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/nv/Rep\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">CNN poll</a> had a total of 1,573 respondents. Of those, only 8% self-identified as Latino. This compares to 24% of voting-age Nevadans overall who the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/releases/2016/cb16-tps14_graphic_voting_nevada.jpg\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Census Bureau</a> identified as Latino or Hispanic.</p> <p>This gives us a subsample of around 126 Latinos. Since 45% of this subsample voted for Trump, according to the poll, the end result is about 57 Latino Trump voters.</p> <p>Small samples bring with them statistical uncertainty. An <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://onlinestatbook.com/2/estimation/proportion_ci.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">extremely conservative estimate for a margin of error</a> for our estimate gives us around plus or minus nine percentage points.</p> <p>Assuming that everything went perfectly with getting a representative subsample of Latino voters in the entrance poll, Trump's actual level of support among Latino Republican caucusgoers in Nevada could have been as low as 36% â or as high as 54%.</p> <p>This level of uncertainty happens whenever we look at small samples, and is one of the major limitations of entrance and exit polls. Drawing sweeping conclusions about populations based on tiny subsamples is a potentially dangerous game.</p> <p>Aside from issues of uncertainty when looking at statistics with small subsamples, it's important to bear in mind that Trump won a plurality of Nevadans who actually went to a Republican caucus. Given that overall turnout for the Republican caucuses was about 75,000 people, this is a very small and likely nonrepresentative fraction of Nevada's population.</p> <p>The general election in November will certainly have a much larger electorate that will very likely look quite different from the subset of Nevadans who attended a caucus.</p> <p>Tuesday's results, then, have very little predictive power about how Latinos, or any other group of voters in the state, will vote this fall.</p> <p>NOW WATCH: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-wins-nevada-caucus-republican-frontrunner-hispanics-low-income-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">âNumber one with Hispanics!â â Trump obliterated Republicans in Nevada</a></p><br /><br /><b>More From Business Insider </b><br />\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-mitt-romney-tweets-tax-returns-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">TRUMP: Mitt Romney was 'one of the dumbest' candidates in GOP history</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-nevada-caucuses-results-wins-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">DONALD TRUMP WINS NEVADA CAUCUSES</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ted-cruz-responds-to-donald-trumps-latest-insult-baby-austin-powers-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">'Hope he doesn't try to eat me!': Ted Cruz responds to Donald Trump's latest insult with 'Austin Powers' joke</a><br /></li>\n  </ul></p> </p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"slideshow","is_eligible":"true","id":"ce29606d-fd22-34d2-9f14-0047b69fa103","licensed":"true","title":"10 Best Anti-Wrinkle Night Creams","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/photos/10-best-anti-wrinkle-night-192531685/","categories":"YCT:001000111","publisher":"Redbook","provider_logo":"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"83716191","propertyRegion":"YPROP:health","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"83716191","site_attribute":"ctopid=\"1996000;1999000;2003000;12819000;1638500;1648500\" hashtag=\"1996000;1999000;2003000;12819000;1638500;1648500\" rs=\"lmsid:a0ad000000BfCP3AAN;revsp:redbook_842;lpstaid:ce29606d-fd22-34d2-9f14-0047b69fa103\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"count":"10","total":"10","description":"Supercharge your beauty sleep.","hosted":true,"publicationDate":"22 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo - ABC News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000111","score":"0.517241","label":"Beauty"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["\nSupercharge your beauty sleep."],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"health","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":493,"width":640,"ratio":77,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/iYnl.fhhu7bET6KQ73OtQQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/redbook_842/aecc4864540b8d53a7a569d7493a9501","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/CtpOi.AkFjkCgED.qYN_Zg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/redbook_842/aecc4864540b8d53a7a569d7493a9501","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[{"caption":"<p>Formulated to work with your natural sleep cycle, this cushiony cream is the iPhone6 of night treatments thanks to its smart ingredients: Hyaluronic acid pulls water into your skin;

But she didn't hit the nerve she was aiming for.</p>","<p>Her open letter to Yelp's CEO â a letter that got her fired â restarted the endless debate over whether millennials face a particularly tough time in the job market or whether they're just more likely to complain about it online.</p>","<h3>How a disgruntled employee started a conversation about living wage</h3>","<p>On February 19, Jane, who worked in customer service at Eat24, wrote a scathing <a href=\"https://medium.com/@taliajane/an-open-letter-to-my-ceo-fb73df021e7a#.j1becqef2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">open letter</a> on Medium to remind Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman what life in San Francisco on less than $24,000 a year feels like.</p>","<p>Jane's letter tells a harsh â in both content and language â story of poverty, where she lives off only a single bag of rice, unable to buy groceries or pay her heating bill. She said she sometimes can't even pay her train fare to work because Yelp underpays and undervalues its employees.</p>","<p>\"So here I am, 25-years old, balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesnât involve crying in the bathtub every week. Every single one of my coworkers is struggling. Theyâre taking side jobs, theyâre living at home. One of them started a GoFundMe because she couldnât pay her rent,\" Jane writes.</p>","<p>Less than two hours after Jane published the letter, she was fired from Eat24. Jane says she was told she was fired because the letter violated Yelp's code of conduct. However, on Saturday Stoppelman tweeted that her firing had nothing to do with the letter.</p>","<div> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3/5 I've not been personally involved in Talia being let go and it was not because she posted a Medium letter directed at me.</p> â Jeremy Stoppelman (@jeremys) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremys/status/701092317046812672\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">February 20, 2016</a> \n </blockquote> \n</div>"],"remaining_body":["<p>A Yelp representative told <a href=\"http://recode.net/2016/02/20/yelp-customer-service-employee-protests-low-pay-in-medium-post-is-promptly-fired/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Re/code</a> the company doesn't comment on personnel issues but \"we did agree with many of the points in Ms. Jane's post.\"</p>","<p>Why did she write the letter?

Supporters saw a post that exposed how bad life can be for the low-wage workers, from Eat24 customer service employees to Uber drivers.</p>","<p>Critics saw an entitled millennial who had mixed up being broke with being poor. Her job paid minimum wage, but it came with generous benefits. Jane's Instagram, critics pointed out, showed photos of prosciutto, Brie, and chocolate â food she told Quartz was given to her for free.<strong> </strong></p>","<h3>What people said about Jane's letter</h3>","<p>Not only did Jane's post go viral, so did its responses.</p>","<p>Stefanie Williams, a 29-year-old college graduate who worked her way from hostessing at a New York bar to writing TV scripts during the recession,Â <a href=\"https://medium.com/@StefWilliams25/an-open-letter-to-millenials-like-talia-52e9597943aa#.g1vv6yb5v\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">responded</a> with \"An Open Letter to Millennials Like Taliaâ¦\" bluntly critiquing Jane's \"whining\" tone and lack of work ethic.</p>","<p>\"Work ethic is not something that develops from entitlement,\" Williams wrote, chiding Jane for asking for donations from readers to support her job search instead of getting a service job. Williams said:</p>","<blockquote> \n <p>Had you ended your whole whining disdain about full health coverage and expensive copays by saying you had taken a job at Starbucks, or a waitressing job in order to make money while you were on the search for a new job that requires the basic knowledge most teenagers with a Twitter account hold these days, Iâd have maybe given you credit.â¦</p> \n <p>But you are a young, white, English speaking woman with a degree and a family who I would assume is helping you out at the moment, and you are asking for handouts from strangers while you sit on your ass looking for cushy jobs you are not entitled to while you complain about the establishment, probably from a nice laptop.
