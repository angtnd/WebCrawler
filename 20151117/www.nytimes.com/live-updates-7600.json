On Friday night you took the life of someone exceptional, the love of my life, the mother of my son, but I will not hate you. I do not know who you are and I do not want to know. You are dead inside. If the God for whom you blindly kill really made us in his image, then each bullet in my wife's body is a wound to his heart.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cSo I will not give you the gift of hate. Even though it is what you were hoping for, responding to hatred with anger would be to fall to the same ignorance that made you the people that you are. You want me to be scared, to distrust my fellow citizens, and to sacrifice my liberty for security. I will play on.\u201d\n\nMr. Leiris said he had seen his wife the morning of the attacks. \u201cShe was as beautiful as she was when she left on Friday night, as beautiful as when I fell forever in love with her more than 12 years ago,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cOf course I am devastated by grief,  I will concede you that small victory, but that will not last long. I know that she will watch over us always and that, one day, we will meet again in that paradise of free souls where you will never be admitted.\u201d\n\nHe ended on a note of optimism. \u201cNow it\u2019s just the two of us, my son and I, but we are stronger than all the armies of the world. In fact, I do not have any more time to waste on you, I need to go and get Melvil, who is waking up from his nap. He is only 17 months old, he will eat his afternoon tea as always and then we will go and play as always, and this little boy's entire life will be an affront to you by being happy and free.

On Friday night you took the life of someone exceptional, the love of my life, the mother of my son, but I will not hate you. I do not know who you are and I do not want to know. You are dead inside. If the God for whom you blindly kill really made us in his image, then each bullet in my wife&#8217;s body is a wound to his heart.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">He went on: \u201cSo I will not give you the gift of hate. Even though it is what you were hoping for, responding to hatred with anger would be to fall to the same ignorance that made you the people that you are. You want me to be scared, to distrust my fellow citizens, and to sacrifice my liberty for security. I will play on.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Mr. Leiris said he had seen his wife the morning of the attacks. \u201cShe was as beautiful as she was when she left on Friday night, as beautiful as when I fell forever in love with her more than 12 years ago,\u201d he wrote.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cOf course I am devastated by grief,  I will concede you that small victory, but that will not last long. I know that she will watch over us always and that, one day, we will meet again in that paradise of free souls where you will never be admitted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">He ended on a note of optimism. \u201cNow it\u2019s just the two of us, my son and I, but we are stronger than all the armies of the world. In fact, I do not have any more time to waste on you, I need to go and get Melvil, who is waking up from his nap. He is only 17 months old, he will eat his afternoon tea as always and then we will go and play as always, and this little boy&#8217;s entire life will be an affront to you by being happy and free.
