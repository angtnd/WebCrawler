Obama announced the executive action in late 2014, but it was challenged in court by 26 states, which argued that he had overstepped his authority and that the program would impose an unfair financial burden on them. The program was blocked by federal courts; only a favorable high court ruling this summer would allow Obama to implement it before he leaves office.

From her soaring popularity during the impeachment hearings of her faithless husband to her brief electoral comeback in the New Hampshire presidential primary in 2008 after misting up in a diner, one of the most battle-scarred figures in American life has proven again and again that she has the capacity to rouse votersâ empathetic instincts.<br /></p>","<p> Now, as Super Tuesdayâs results bring us closer to a general election between Clinton and Trump, two brash New Yorkers who do not shy away from a fight, an unprecedented question looms. How does a man whose insults and old-school machismo only amp his popularity compete against a woman who has made an art form of turning the other cheek to such attacks? <br /></p>","<p> In other words, how ugly will things get should Donald Trump run against Hillary Clinton? And how good â or bad â for each of them might that be? </p>","<p> âIt will be a war,â says Rebecca Traister, who wrote a book, âBig Girls Donât Cry,â about Clintonâs 2008 race, and has just published another, <a href=\"http://books.simonandschuster.com/All-the-Single-Ladies/Rebecca-Traister/9781476716565\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">âAll the Single Ladies,â</a> about Clintonâs most important constituency this time around. âTrump is popular because he is channeling the anxiety of those who are losing power â white men â to those who are gaining it â women and minoritiesâ and he is willing to say anything that expresses that hate.â </p>","<p>Certain conventions have been accepted about the political ground rules for running for office as a woman and for male candidates running against a woman, wisdom carefully accumulated over the decades by consultants working with focus groups. </p>","<p> Now, all of them are about to be upended.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Men are more analytical and women more emotional? Many voters see it the other way around this time. Men are traditionally seen as insiders while women are seen as outsiders? Those roles are flipped in the cases of Clinton and Trump. Women, arguably, are traditionally credited by voters with honesty and the ability to bring about change. Those are Clintonâs weakest areas, according to pollsters (though Trump doesnât fare well on the honesty count, either).</p>","<p> And then there is a long list of things that men are supposed to avoid when running against a woman candidate: Never call her names, insult her looks, patronize her, act like a bully, encroach upon her physical space or appear physically threatening. (No, until this campaign, it wasnât considered good strategy to do this to candidates of <i>any</i> gender, but there is an added menace perceived by voters when <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html?_r=0\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> a man appears to demean or humiliate his female opponent</a>.) <br /></p>","<p>Trump, though, has done most of these things to many people who have gotten in his way thus far in the campaign, including more than a few women. Megyn Kelly, for instance, whom he called a âbimboâ and suggested she was hormonally unstable. Or Carly Fiorina, of whom he said, âLook at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Sheâs a woman, and Iâm not supposed to say bad things, but really folks, come on!

Based on conversations with Trump and comments the candidate has made in public over the years, DâAntonio says Trump divides women into âwhoâs a 10 and whoâs not a 10, who he would like to have sex with and who he wouldnât. The impulse is so strong in him to attack, and to do it in the lowest possible way will be irresistible to him.â </p>","<p> Adds Connecticut <a href=\"http://www.courant.com/politics/capitol-watch/hc-malloy-picks-hillary-clinton-20150607-story.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Clinton supporter</a>: âHe has a long history of offending women, and heâs not likely to change his stripes. Trumpâs never met a group that he couldnât offend.â </p>","<p> <b> </b> </p>","<p>The Trump campaign could not be reached for comment for this article. But Trumpâs lawyer Michael Cohen has previously told Yahoo News, âThis notion that Donald Trump hates women, that heâs a misogynist â thatâs just plain wrong.â And Trump himself has repeatedly claimed to âcherishâ women. </p>","<p> Less clear is the effect that any such attacks might have on 2016 voters. Subtle sexist attacks have arguably worked against Clinton in the past. These include the backlash against Clinton in her efforts to reform health care during her husbandâs presidency and the allegation at that time that she was running a so-called co-presidency. This animosity also informed the existence of groups like Citizens United Not Timid, reportedly founded in 2007 by Roger Stone, now a Trump supporter, which raised money to combat Clinton during her first presidential campaign, using the first letters of each word as its logo.<a href=\"#_msocom_2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"></a> </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img height=\"511.36\" width=\"640\" alt=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/PoW9semkwTLSbOEvO8DEHg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://36.media.tumblr.com/6d9435fe851d1a583bae910bdd3906fc/tumblr_inline_o3ecn9DwJ41smb3m3_1280.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p> <i>First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton stands by her husband,<i>Â PresidentÂ </i>Bill Clinton, <i>in the White House in 1998,</i>Â after he denied engaging in improper behavior with intern Monica Lewinsky.

Presidential candidate Barack Obama was forced to explain himself after he said, âYou can put lipstick on a pig, and itâs still a pig,â because Republicans believed he was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/10/campaign.lipstick\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">insulting Sen. John McCainâs vice presidential running mate, Sarah Palin</a>.

Claire McCaskill of Missouri has admitted that her campaign actively helped Todd Akin win the Republican nomination in the 2012 Missouri Senate race, bargaining that he would say something that would offend women in the general election. (His chances were shot after he let loose a line about âlegitimate rape.â)</p>","<p>Add to that general guideline the more specific fact that Clinton has done particularly well when she is under attack. Think of such moments as the scandal over her husbandâs infidelity, which resulted in Hillary Clintonâs highest approval rating in her two decades in public service. Or the first debate during her run for a New York Senate seat, when her opponent, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/03/hillary-clinton-rick-lazio-2000-senate-sexism\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Rick Lazio</a>, marched across the stage, wagged his finger at her and waved some pages of a finance pledge in her face, demanding that she sign it. Post-debate polls (helped along by a lot of post-debate advertising by the Clinton camp) found that voters saw him as a sexist bully and that this incident marked a turning point toward her eventual victory. Another such moment came in the 2008 New Hampshire debate in which Obama told her, âYouâre <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/barack-obama-tells-hillary-clinton-shes-likeable-34428886\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">likable enough</a>, Hillary.â The resulting outrage from women voters may have lost him the New Hampshire primary. Most recently, ClintonâsÂ <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/22/politics/hillary-clinton-benghazi-hearing-updates/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">11-hour marathon</a> hearing before the Congressional Select Committee on Benghazi helped confirm the impression among many Democrats that she had proved her strength and stamina. </p>","<p> It would follow, then, that the coarser her opponentsâ comments become, the better she will fare. But in a year where all bets are off, will this conventional wisdom work? </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img height=\"427.95180722891564\" width=\"640\" alt=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/uEBUhyD.srKuQ9_iXzCcnA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/ab14ee4e9ddbe8275d2785d9c34467a6/tumblr_inline_o3ecpn9fH21smb3m3_1280.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Former Rep.

(Photo: Richard Drew/AP)</i></p>","<p>Already, Trump has turned the gender tables on Clinton, proving himself a skilled fighter on terrain that might have undone her other opponents. After Trump asserted that Clinton had been âschlongedâ by Obama in the 2008 election, she responded that Trump had shown a âpenchant for sexism.â He, in turn, accused her of <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-steals-hillary-clinton-sexism-line-article-1.2477946\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">playing the âwoman cardâ</a> and tweeted: âHillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HEâS DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!â </p>","<p> A day or two of news stories and editorial columns followed, in which the focus shifted from Hillary the wronged wife to the Hillary who was willing to stand by her predatory husband. </p>","<p> Which leaves veterans and prognosticators in new territory. âItâs hard to judge Donald Trump on those kinds of things, because he says such strange, somewhat irresponsible things, and it hasnât seemed to harm him in the primaries thus far,â says Dick Riley, who was Bill Clintonâs secretary of education and who has <a href=\"http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/18/dick-riley-endorses-hillary-clinton/31916035/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">endorsed</a> his wife. âPeople seem to respond differently to him than they have to other people.â </p>","<p>DâAntonio echoes this thought, saying: âYou canât predict anything about his effect on people.â He recalls a Trump rally where the candidate called out a male protester for being fat âand people in the room didnât recoil, they cheered. Even though a lot of the people cheering were also fat. In order not to be the target, you join the bully.â </p>","<p><i>Liz Goodwin contributed reporting to this story.</i><br /></p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/2016-presidential-campaign-debates/jamie-lee-curtis-clintons-authenticity-005441091.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>"]},"property":"politics","images":[{"caption":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","id":"281cd54b-2b16-35b7-91c0-462a6b06ef19","title":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","type":"photo","shortCaption":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/s_3s4k5EXjVQTkHfZt5WXg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/fafe546800e1655876f7dea565ea789d","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","id":"8fa2f89d-079c-3462-bd6b-21c01d449766","title":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","type":"photo","shortCaption":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/AHyGa8L63Ln8OUW7Aw.7qQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/120b06304dac9bbc301fbc7947b1ba26","alt":null},"index":2},{"caption":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","id":"b1a4a4a7-bbcd-33c2-bdb5-433de4b23cf5","title":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","type":"photo","shortCaption":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/DFWQSsErMsDZzwt7DjKXzw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/100bdb2927b3b62d147fcdb50d9a6bb2","alt":null},"index":3},{"caption":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","id":"aa236f62-b30a-3ffa-9d3b-ca020b291be2","title":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","type":"photo","shortCaption":"How Trumpâs âbullyingâ would play against Clinton","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/0Vae_1ct7nEnZylPzmNAAg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/8e8d6bc72e6b4dd3057b7bc069319528","alt":null},"index":4},{"caption":"Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have both said they will be a unifying presence for the US electorate.","id":"589db0fc-12ed-361e-8a14-dec20f9cc4ad","title":"Trump v Clinton: Who would unify US?","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have both said they will be a unifying presence for the US electorate.","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/XJbk_qljwC60JXt4LVzcMA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://d.yimg.com/hd/bbc/1/7/27e82848-7fe1-4525-a592-fabbf1482783_gdQ83isnWJcNtnnP4u4rtnnaWvUmKlamaM_YADmnt2VL-crFLWGqvhTZjrHYLK-XqZreEznAVRs-_2_0.jpg?s=b867f6a4d6f4730a756b9b93a30d60dc&c=ce451cf393bf94aa288630b587ea902a&a=bbc&mr=0","alt":"Trump v Clinton: Who would unify US?"},"index":5},{"caption":"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump won the most Super Tuesday delegates, while Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders each took several states.","id":"42711a7f-2bae-3b1f-9cf1-5ec50c14c987","title":"Clinton, Trump win big on Super Tuesday","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump won the most Super Tuesday delegates, while Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders each took several states.","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/UXQJLtiFaFCxLb5rVWhtDQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.wabc.abc.news.com/0a8767ce11c6690ce35dd97b90f3f599","alt":"Clinton, Trump win big on Super Tuesday"},"index":6},{"caption":"Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.

Julissa Arce will be on talking about why she thinks Donald Trump is unqualifed to be president.</em></strong><br /> </p> <p> A few months ago, a Trump GOP nomination seemed impossible. But now, it seems inevitable. </p> <p> When <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/?__source=yahoo|finance|inline|story|story&par=yahoo&doc=103434196\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> <strong>Donald Trump</strong> </a> announced his campaign, I thought there was no way anyone would support him after the comments he made about Mexican immigrants. When he offended women with his comments about debate moderator Megyn Kelly, I thought his campaign would be over. When he called for a ban of all Muslims, I thought that would be the last straw. But again and again, Trump has gained more support. </p> <p> <br /> </p> <p> We've been telling Trump supporters that he is a racist, a sexist, and a bigot, as reasons for why Trump should not and cannot be the next president of the United States. However, we've failed to realize that supporters of Trump support him because he is the embodiment of their own ideology. Trump's unexpected rise as the GOP front-runner is because there is a large population of Americans who feel displaced, who feel like their country and their way of life is being taken away from them. Trump has offered this population an unashamed and unfiltered rallying cry.<br /> </p> <p> We have been going about this all wrong. There is really only one reason Trump supporters should not support Trump: He is not qualified.<br /> </p> <p> And by that, I mean that he is not qualified to deliver on any of his promises. </p> <p> One of the major pillars of his campaign is his building of the now infamous \"big, beautiful wall\" along the Mexican border. The wall got 10 feet taller after ex-Mexican President Vicente Fox said he was \"not going to pay for that f--ing wall.\" </p> <p> I understand some people are excited about the wall. In their mind, the wall would keep all those \"illegals\" away from American jobs. While Trump has said repeatedly that <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/28/donald-trump-mexico-going-to-pay-for-wall.html?__source=yahoo|finance|inline|story|story&par=yahoo&doc=103434196\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> <strong>Mexico will pay for the wall</strong> </a>, how does an American president make another sovereign nation pay for anything? Trump has yet to outline a concrete plan. </p> <p> The only vague answer we've been able to get from Trump is that he plans to use the trade deficit with Mexico as a way to pressure Mexico to pay for the wall. The U.S. does have a trade deficit with Mexico, but it is also true that Mexico was our third largest trade partner in 2015. In 2015 alone, our total trade of goods with the rest of the globe was $3.7 trillion, of which more than 14 percent ($ 531.1 billion) was with Mexico. He puts that at risk. </p> <br /> <p> Let's assume that Trump can stop all Mexican products from coming into the U.S. ($294.7 billion in 2015) to pressure Mexico to pay for the wall. (Even this is a stretch, as there are trade agreements in place that would have to be suspended with the approval of Congress. But let's assume that for now.) </p> <p> Let's not forget that Mexico can also refuse to import American products in retaliation for their own products not being allowed into the United States. Products that are made in American factories that employ U.S. citizens. In 2015, we exported $236.4 billion to our neighbors to the south. <br /> </p> <p> A 2011 report by the Wilson Center found that there are 6 million U.S. jobs that depend on trade with Mexico. More than 1 million of those jobs are in two states â California and Texas. </p> <br /> <p>And it's not just border states that depend on trade with Mexico. South Dakota, New Hampshire, and Nebraska also send more than 20 percent of their exports to our southern neighbor, according to the Wilson Center.<br /></p> <p> Mexico is the largest supplier of car parts that are then used to build cars in plants in the U.S. where American citizens are employed. The Wilson Center found that Detroit alone exports $10.9 billion in cars and car parts to Mexico.<br /> </p> <p>How would Trump deal with a potential loss of 6 million jobs or more? Is it worth destroying the economies of Michigan, California, and Texas? <br /></p> <p> All this â¦ over a wall. </p> <p> Yes, Mexico's economy is certainly going to suffer if Mexican products cannot be imported into the U.S. At this point, net migration from Mexico is near zero, as there are as many Mexicans leaving the U.S. as there are coming in. But what has driven millions of immigrants over the border in previous years? A search for economic opportunity, a better life. If Mexico's economy worsens, we will see a reversal of recent migration patterns. Because, while Trump pressures Mexico by cutting off trade, Mexicans won't be able to find jobs in Mexico, which will send them here. </p> <p> So while all of us anti-Trump think he should not be president because of his hateful speech and rhetoric, Trump supporters should just ask themselves one simple question: Is he qualified to deliver on his vague promises to you? On any? </p> <p> <em>Commentary by Julissa Arce, the author of the forthcoming book, \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455540242?ref_=sr_1_1&qid=1456331261&sr=8-1&keywords=julissa arce&pldnSite=1\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">My (Underground) American Dream</a>\" (Sept. 13, 2016).

She's also said she would seek to pass the \"Buffett Rule,\" which would close tax loopholes by establishing a higher minimum rate for those in the highest income bracket.</p> \n  <p>Clinton appears to want to appeal to middle-class voters with retirement savings accounts as well as consumer advocates who warn that the Democratic Party has a history of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/opinion/democrats-republicans-and-wall-street-tycoons.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Wall Street appeasement</a> that rivals that of the Republicans. </p> \n  <p>\"If she is thinking about a policy issue, she's going to want to hear from the business side, the consumer side, the labor side, and in that regard, her positions may not be starkly black-and-white,\" said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tracysefl?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Tracy Sefl</a>, a Democratic strategist and former Clinton campaign staffer. \"She likes to bring together multiple voices.<br /> <br /> Here's how Clinton plans to deal with the overarching issues affecting the country's economy -- and what effects her actions will have (assuming she's able to push her agenda through Congress):<br /> <br /> <strong>Wall Street Regulation</strong> </p> \n  <p>One thing is clear: Clinton isn't going to adopt Sanders' call to break up the country's largest banks. While Sanders has said he'd reinstate Glass-Steagall within his first year in office, Clinton has countered that more must be done to regulate hedge funds and other entities within the so-called \"<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shadow-banking-system.asp\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">shadow banking</a>\" system. <br /> <br /> In the wake of Clinton's overwhelming wins on Super Tuesday through much of the South, her focus is turning away from Sanders and toward Donald Trump and the Republicans. It's a change of course that will allow Clinton to emphasize that while she wants to expand Dodd-Frank, Trump and the rest of the Republican field wants to <a href=\"https://americanbridgepac.org/entire-gop-field-would-repeal-dodd-frank-return-power-to-wall-street/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">repeal</a> it.<br /> <br /> Coming just seven years after unemployment spiked to 17% in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Clinton clearly wants to run on a platform of tougher Wall Street enforcement. And for good reason. Some 67% of the U.S. populace wants a president who favors stricter regulation of financial institutions, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted in October. Even Republicans to the tune of 58% said they want a candidate willing to toughen Wall Street oversight.<br /> <br /> \"It's no surprise that people who were hurt by the crisis want to be protected from Wall Street,\" Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a non-profit organization that lobbies for strict enforcement of Dodd-Frank, said in a phone interview from Washington. \"Given the hostility of the American people toward financial institutions, no one can get elected, saying they're going to side with Wall Street.\"<br /> <br /> And that puts Clinton in a tight position. In recent weeks, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/opinion/mrs-clinton-show-voters-those-transcripts.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">The New York Times</a> has joined with Sanders in calling for Clinton to make public the transcripts to her paid speeches to many of the country's largest financial institutions. Suspicions are high that Clinton doesn't want those speeches made public for fear they would reveal a politician eager to please bankers. <br /> <br /> For her part, Clinton has steadfastly insisted that being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to speak to financial firms doesn't preclude her from supporting Dodd-Frank or the Consumer Protection Act, the cornerstone of Obama's financial reforms. In a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/11/transcript-the-democratic-debate-in-milwaukee-annotated/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Feb. 11 debate</a> with Sanders, Clinton said she would seek to re-insert regulations that Republicans took out of the bill in exchange for passage.<br /> <br /> First and foremost was a bank tax to help pay to implement the law. Second was the so-called Volcker Rule. aimed at discouraging banks from making risky investments.<br /> <br /> \"This would be a sensible, moderate way to address banks taking risks,\" Jeffrey Frankel, macro-economics professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said in a phone interview from Cambridge, Mass. \"Republicans have consistently tried to limit funding on the enforcement agencies, both the Consumer Protection Bureau and existing ones. These are steps to raise a little money for enforcement and tax the riskier activities of the big banks.\"<br /> \n   <story_page_break></story_page_break> <br /> Clinton has also <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/10/08/wall-street-work-for-main-street/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">proposed</a> levying a \"graduated risk fee every year on the liabilities of banks with more than $50 billion in assets, and other financial institutions that are designed by regulators for enhanced oversight.\" Those fees, Clinton says, would be scaled \"higher for firms with greater amounts of debt and riskier, short-term forms of debt.\" Clinton likens it to a deterrent, a rainy day fund. <br /> <br /> She would also seek legislation to hold executives accountable by extending the statute of limitations for major financial crimes to 10 years from 5 years, and requiring that executives lose bonus pay when a bank pays a fine related to their bad decisions. Additionally, Clinton has also called for addressing executive compensation schemes that Kelleher says \"induce and incentivize recklessness.<br /> <br /> Unlike Sanders, though, Clinton doesn't support restoring Glass-Steagall, which was passed in 1936 in the throes of the Depression to separate commercial banking from investment banking. She insists that even if Glass-Steagall hadn't been repealed, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Bear Stearns, among others wouldn't have been prevented from making risky bets. <br /> <br /> Rather than focusing on Glass-Steagall, Clinton counters that a different kind of regulatory framework is needed to monitor hedge funds and other non-bank institutions, adding that Dodd-Frank could be used to break up banks, if that's what was required.<br /> <br /> Nonetheless, a group of 170 economists who support Bernie Sanders' more aggressive plans to regulate Wall Street have signed a letter arguing that Clinton's plan <a href=\"http://usuncut.com/politics/170-top-economists-back-bernie-sanders-plan-to-rein-in-wall-street/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">doesn't sufficiently reduce risk in the financial system</a>, leaving the government vulnerable to institutions deemed too big to fail.</p> \n  <p>\"Sanders overstates the banking part of finance, and Clinton overstates the shadow banking part of finance,\" Kelleher said. \"Clinton has to continue to talk about importance of regulating the shadow banking system but she needs to also address the too big to fail banks on Wall Street. They're both right but they both have more work to do.\"</p> \n  <p> <strong>Remaking the U.S. Tax Code</strong> </p> \n  <p>This is a biggie, and strikes at the heart of the conflicting world views of the two major parties. <br /> <br /> To highlight her differences with the Republican candidates, Clinton has been emphasizing in campaign speeches that as president she would seek to close the so-called \"carried interest loophole.\" In effect, the provision allows money managers, hedge fund operators, to treat fees on their clients' investments as capital gains, which are taxed at a maximum rate of 23.8% rather than the 39.6% rate applied to ordinary income.<br /> <br /> Closing the loophole, and raising taxes on short-term capital gains, are being pitched as concrete steps aimed addressing income inequality, an issue resonating with both Democrats and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-11-12/rising-income-inequality-causes-republicans-to-shift-rhetoric-but-not-policy\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Republicans</a>.<br /> <br /> The carried interest loophole allows \"individuals making more than $450 million a year on average are taxed at a lower rate than teachers making around $50,000 on average,\" <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/257083-what-the-carried-interest-tax-loophole-reveals-about-our\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">wrote</a> Morris Pearl, former managing director of <strong>Black Rock</strong>, the asset management firm. \"There is no more striking example of the cost of corruption than tax loopholes that benefit the 1%.\"<br /> <br /> Congress considered doing away with the carried interest loophole back in 2012 when Rep. Dave Camp, a Republican who chaired the Ways & Means Committee, proposed <a href=\"http://t.sidekickopen21.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XYg7fRFRKVS9MNM7fcksnN7q48d91vl5Gf6Jl7gj03?t=http%3A%2F%2Fdealbook.nytimes.com%2F2014%2F02%2F26%2Fhouse-proposal-would-raise-taxes-on-private-equity-income%2F&si=6398287083208704&pi=18004533-91ae-4373-e460-8f8a55128863\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">a sweeping tax reform plan</a> that included treating carried interest as regular income. Yet even as the House approved such a measure, it died in the Senate.</p> \n  <p>Along these same lines, Clinton last week announced a plan to levy a 4% \"surcharge\" on people earning more than $5 million, generating about $150 billion over 10 years. That's not going to retire the national debt, but it does send a message at a time when her Democratic rival Sanders is gathering strength from progressives insisting that government take substantive actions to address income inequality.</p> \n  <p>Essentially, if you're super-rich or make most of your money investing, your taxes <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/01/13/462944798/hillary-clinton-s-new-tax-proposal-likely-wont-affect-you\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">will probably go up</a> under a President Clinton. </p> \n  <p>Raising taxes on the wealthy doesn't necessarily hurt the economy, said <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/experts/michael-lind/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Michael Lind</a>, a senior fellow at New America, a Washington-based think tank. Tax rates on the highest wage earners was higher before the 1980s when the economy was growing faster, he said.</p> \n  <p>\"The real question is the 'dead-weight loss' of tax avoidance, tax evasion because rich people have the resources as well as the incentives to avoid paying taxes,\" Lind said in a phone interview. \"That's a loss to the economy, and has a very real impact on raising the deficit.\"</p> \n  <p>To lower the federal deficit, it will likely be necessary for the next president to widen the tax burden for those earning less than $250,000 through increases in sales or consumption taxes, he added. This is not part of Clinton's plan.</p> \n  <p>Critics of Clinton's tax plan say that higher investing taxes -- that are already too high -- will <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2015/08/01/hillary-clintons-tax-plan-would-be-devastating-critics/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">hurt economic growth by disincentivizing investment</a>. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, a Clinton supporter, has said, however, that <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/26/business/la-fi-mo-warren-buffett-taxes-wealthy-obama-20121126\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">higher taxes on investing won't stop the rich from doing so</a>. <br /> <br /> </p> \n  <p> <strong>U.S. Corporations, Trade and Foreign Policy</strong> </p> \n  <p>While U.S. corporations may differ with Clinton on taxes, she proved her worth as secretary of state in negotiating free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea.<br /> <br /> Yet it was in Mexico, where Clinton may have forged her most significant achievement when she helped to negotiate an agreement with Mexico and its state-run oil and natural gas company <strong>Petroleos Mexicanos</strong> (Pemex) to open drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico. The agreement, made on behalf of U.S. energy companies, was hashed out in December 2013 with the signing of the <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/oil-deal-us-mexico-pact-spotlights-obama-clinton-support-fossil-fuel-development\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Agreement</a>, which established a framework to allow U.S. companies to work with Pemex to develop oil reserves that straddle the underwater boundary between the two countries.<br /> <br /> The agreement was approved by Congress, signed by Obama and <a href=\"http://www.api.org/News-and-Media/testimony-speeches/2013/Testimony-Erik-Milito-at-the-Senate-Committee-Energy-and-Natural-Resources\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">hailed as a landmark achievement by the <strong>American Petroleum Institute</strong></a>.<br /> <br /> Working for the Obama administration, Clinton also helped to lay the groundwork for the Trans-Pacific Partnership even as she has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/13/hillary-clinton/what-hillary-clinton-really-said-about-tpp-and-gol/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">changed her position on the trade treaty as a presidential candidate</a>. The sweeping agreement, negotiated in closed meetings with 11 Pacific Rim nations, lays out myriad rules to lower import tariffs. <br /> <br /> \n   <story_page_break></story_page_break> <br /> Yet trade treaties have proven to be political liabilities as many Americans believe they send jobs overseas, and Clinton was quick to distance herself from TPP, which is expected to go before Congress in the spring.<br /> <br /> In an <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-tpp_56157832e4b0fad1591a9289\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">interview with PBS</a>, Clinton said that she was \"worried about currency manipulation not being part of the agreement. We've lost American jobs to the manipulations that countries, particularly in Asia, have engaged in.\" Her flip-flop on TPP, however, has opened her to criticism from both Sanders, and Republican candidates.<br /> <br /> The same can be said of her <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/06/hillary-clinton-doctrine-obama-interventionist-tough-minded-president/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">support</a> for authoritarian regimes such as Hosni Mubarak's Egypt and military coup that ousted Honduras's democratically elected president Manual Zelaya. Both cases reflect the historic economic underpinning of U.S. foreign policy: to open markets for U.S. corporations.</p> \n  <p>While supportive of U.S. corporations doing business abroad, Clinton has been critical of efforts by some companies to skirt U.S. taxes by executing mergers with non-U.S. entities. Paradoxically, that's a position she shares with GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, who has condemned the use of so-called tax inversion deals.<br /> <br /> In November, Trump sided with Clinton when she <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/23/with-pfizer-deal-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton-finally-agree-on-something/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">slammed</a> New York-based Pfizer Inc. for executing a $150 billion merger with Ireland's Allergan PLC in order to change its headquarters, thereby leaving \"U.S. taxpayers holding the bag.\"</p> \n  <p>Free trade is widely <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=is%20free%20trade%20good%20for%20the%20economy\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">considered to be good for the economy</a>. Despite the current rhetoric, Clinton is likely to continue to support it. </p> \n  <p>\"She is positioning herself as Obama's heir on issues such as trade,\" said <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/staff_kyle.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Kyle Kondik</a>, managing editor of politics website <em>Sabato's Crystal Ball</em> at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, in an interview from Charlottesville, Va. \"Yes, she did flip on the Trans-Pacific partnership but that's likely to be settled before she would enter office.\"</p> \n  <p> <strong>Wages and Jobs</strong> </p> \n  <p>Lately, Clinton has been describing herself as a \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-progressive_561dafabe4b050c6c4a35c32\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">progressive</a>,\" an indication that she wants to position herself to the left of where she might have been in the past. <br /> <br /> That past included serving on the board of directors at <strong>WalMart</strong> for six years (1986-92) at a time when the company's worker relations were infamous, and helping to build strategy for an Arkansas governor who rode the centrist Democratic Leadership Council's push for free trade, tough-on-crime policies and welfare reform straight to the White House.</p> \n  <p>The DLC, of course, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2011/02/the-end-of-the-dlc-era-049041\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">closed its doors</a> back in 2011, a clear sign that the party has moved left. <br /> <br /> And now Clinton wants to show that <a href=\"%22http:/www.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/opinion/hillary-clinton-how-id-rein-in-wall-street.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">she has</a> moved left as well, especially on issues of union organizing, immigration and raising the minimum wage, Kondik added. </p> \n  <p>\"We can expect a high level of continuity with Obama's policies if she's elected,\" Kondik said. \"While she has tried to move to left a little bit to satisfy the more populist wing of the part, I don't think she is naturally more liberal on economic issues than Obama is, she might actually be less but she's moved to where the party is, which has become more liberal over time.\"</p> \n  <p>At the top of that list is wage stagnation, a direct product of income inequality, which is arguably a product of a tax code with elements that Democrats have called regressive. As <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/09/24/stiglitz-why-rich-are-so-much-richer/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">James Surowiecki</a> wrote recently in the New York Review of Books \"the top 1% of earners take home more than 20% of the income, and their share has more than doubled in the last 35 years. Over that same period, wages and household incomes have risen only slightly.\"<br /> <br /> Forcing employers to raise salaries probably begins with raising the federal minimum wage. Since 2009, that's been $7.25 an hour. Clinton has been supportive of the labor-led <a href=\"http://fightfor15.org/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">fight for $15</a> but has also said <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-raise-federal-minimum-wage-to-12-per-hour_56394247e4b0411d306eca12\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">$12 is a more reasonable target</a>, considering regional differences.<br /> <br /> Whether or not raising the minimum wage would hurt the economy is a source of much debate -- and policy papers -- from competing think tanks, industry lobbyists and labor unions. Yet accepting that some change and displacement would occur, raising the minimum wage may actually be a net longer-term positive for the economy, argues New America's Lind.</p> \n  <p>\"Obviously, businesses that would be unable to pay a higher minimum, whatever it is, would suffer,\" Lind said. \"But having a minimum wage that drives low-wage businesses out of existence arguably is a good thing, as it can force businesses to invest in technology rather than labor, which is a good thing from the point of view of overall national productivity.\"</p> \n  <p> <strong>Reality With Republicans Controlling Congress</strong> </p> \n  <p>To get any of these proposals enacted, Clinton would likely have to barter with a House of Representatives that likely will remain in Republican hands. Assuming that Clinton is elected president and the Democrats fair poorly in mid-term elections, which is customary, Clinton runs the risk of being the first Democratic president to serve without ever having her party control the House.</p> \n  <p>As a result, raising the minimum wage or increasing taxes on higher earners would probably require a grand bargain with Republicans that might have to include lowering the corporate tax rate.</p> \n  <p>\"Because the political situation will probably be much like it is now, her ability to pass landmark legislation would be blocked,\" Kondick said. \"If you thought Obama's relationship with the House was bad, I don't see why Clinton's would be better. We could be looking at more stalemate.<br /> <br /> Whether such an impasse could be broken would depend on one party gaining significant momentum coming out the election in November. Ultimately, though, Clinton's ability to move her economic agenda will rest on how she decides to govern. Will it be through the centrist positions of her husband's administration, the liberal doctrines of Barack Obama or the populism of Bernie Sanders.<br /> <br /> Only Hillary knows.</p> \n </body></p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance"},{"type":"video","is_eligible":"true","id":"6485a575-36d3-361e-805f-5ee615594923","title":"Indian consulate targeted in deadly Afghan attack","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/video/indian-consulate-targeted-deadly-afghan-164747943.html","image_assets":{"width":"1280","height":"720","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B00GH4meZH1VWDy.DJPAkw--/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://d.yimg.com/hd/afpus/3/8/1a5a471b-ec7c-4c6b-afd1-ca484701bbd5_ARPUNkF0CJIICu30K8xafur-SAuwDSsHpuMBSNedPPEqoTS5KgnxJP2INMaHT6vYMmCrDxhhvfk-_2_0.jpg?s=f2a1ef35eb9f358ee17bd9abd277292a&c=9f4d1b1b85f7aefd18791999314fc491&a=afpus&mr=0","tag":"size=original"},"summary":"Gunfire and an explosion echoed Wednesday as militants attacked India&#39;s consulate in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, killing three people in the latest in a string of assaults on Indian installations in the country.","categories":"YCT:001000661","publisher":"AFP Videos","provider_logo":"","site":"news","region":"us","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"7645365","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"7645365","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Consul_%28representative%29;India;Jalalabad\" ctopid=\"1996000\" hashtag=\"1996000\" rs=\"lmsid:a0ad00000089OcyAAE;revsp:video.afpvideosus.com;lpstaid:6485a575-36d3-361e-805f-5ee615594923\"","site":"news","region":"us","lang":"en-US"},"duration":"0:01:03","hosted":true,"publicationDate":"39 minutes ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo -
