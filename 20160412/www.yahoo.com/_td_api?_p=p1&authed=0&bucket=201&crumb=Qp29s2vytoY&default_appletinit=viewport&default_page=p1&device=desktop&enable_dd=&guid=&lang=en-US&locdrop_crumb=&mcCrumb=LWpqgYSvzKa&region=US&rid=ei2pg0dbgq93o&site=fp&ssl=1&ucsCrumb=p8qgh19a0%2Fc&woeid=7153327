This is instant credibility for a program that had very little.</p>","<p>And then there is the temporary insanity that seems to have gripped the Atlantic Coast Conference â specifically Georgia Tech and Pittsburgh. The hires there, made by a pair of respected athletic directors, boggle the mind.</p>","<p>Mike Bobinski at Georgia Tech fired Brian Gregory and replaced him with Josh P-P-P-Pastner. Letâs just say that Memphis fans were happier to see Pastner go than Tech fans were to see him arrive â the only thing keeping him employed was a bloated buyout, part of a silly 2013 raise that gave him a salary of $2.65 million a year. Bobinski hired a guy whose well-appointed program over the past two years had not performed as well as the guy he just fired.</p>","<p>Scott Barnes at Pitt replaced Dixon and his 11 NCAA tourney bids in 13 seasons with Kevin Stallings, to the giddy disbelief of many Vanderbilt backers who were hoping to get rid of a guy who made the Big Dance seven times in 17 years and was a widely perceived underachiever over the last four seasons.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>So there you go, Tech and Pitt fans. Those are the guys who are going to slug it out in the toughest coaching conference in the country, competing nose-to-nose with Mike Kryzyzewski, Roy Williams, Rick Pitino, Jim Boeheim, Mike Brey and Jim Larranaga.</p>","<p>Buy your season tickets today!</p>","<p>\"I mean, look, it's not going to happen overnight,\" Pastner said upon his introduction at Tech. \"We're going to have to take a step back to take two steps forward.\"</p>","<p>Pastnerâs last step forward was three years ago, when his 31-win Memphis team earned a No. 6 NCAA tournament seed. The Tigers were routed in the second round by Michigan State and have disappointed ever since.</p>","<p>After dwarfing Conference USA, Memphis and Pastner failed to do the same in the American Athletic Conference â or to even come close. Pastner had every advantage at Memphis â a great arena, a practice facility, a passionate fan base, a ton of tradition and a brand that sold well in recruiting.</p>","<p>He did little with it. The Tigers finished in a three-way tie for third in the league their first year, and were the fifth-best AAC team according to Ken Pomeroyâs rankings. After that it was downhill: tied for fifth in 2015 and missed the NCAA tourney; an abysmal seventh in 2016 and never even merited serious tourney consideration.</p>","<p>Memphisâ final Pomeroy Rating in 2015: 92. Georgia Techâs, under Gregory: 83. The Tigersâ 10-8 league mark included losses to Tulane and East Carolina.</p>","<p>Memphisâ final Pomeroy Rating in 2016: 72. Georgia Techâs, under Gregory: 49.</p>","<p>During those two seasons, the Tigers lost to East Carolina twice, Tulane twice and South Florida once. Those are five losses to teams that likely would pull a Boston College and go winless in the ACC.</p>","<p>Pastnerâs allure, such as it is, comes from his recruiting ability. Gregory had nine players from talent-rich Georgia on his final Tech roster â but not the right nine. The first challenge for Pastner will be to keep the best players at home. The second (and bigger) challenge will be to actually coach them up to a level where he can beat some of the biggest names in the sport.<span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1460416224447\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Left\"><img title=\"How will Pittsburgh fare without longtime coach Jamie Dixon?

With the Southeastern Conference at something of a modern nadir in recent years, failing at putting teams in the NCAA tourney and making a national impact beyond Kentucky and Florida, Vandy was a big part of the problem. The Commodoresâ conference record over the past four years: 33-37. With at least two potential NBA draft picks on the roster this past season, they snuck into the NCAA tournament as one of the last four invitees and were promptly throttled in the play-in round by Wichita State.</p>","<p>All things considered, it would have been just as well if the NCAA had followed through on its erroneous invite to South Carolina instead of Vandy.</p>","<p>Pitt is gambling that the 55-year-old Stallings can make an impact on prospects in an area that hasÂ  been only a tangential part of Vanderbiltâs national recruiting strategy. Dixon made a lot of hay recruiting blue-collar, in-state players, along the Atlantic seaboard and in the New York area. Stallings will have his work cut out for him replicating that.</p>","<p>What do the Pitt and Georgia Tech situations have in common, beyond spit-take hires? Search firms. Pitt used Collegiate Sports and Todd Turner, the former AD at Connecticut, North Carolina State, Vanderbilt and Washington. Tech used DHR International and Glenn Sugiyama.</p>","<p>Of course, virtually everybody uses a search firm these days. But oftentimes, the top candidates come from an ADâs wish list â the search firm is simply there to provide communication cover.</p>","<p>For both Pitt and Tech, basketball insiders say their lofty initial hopes were shot down. Thatâs when it became more of a firm-directed search. Pittsburghâs search coincidentally led it to the guy Turner hired at Vanderbilt 17 years earlier. Techâs search led it to Pastner.</p>","<p>Both coaches clearly were ready to jump before being pushed. Itâs not an uncommon exit strategy in college basketball, sometimes leading to some strange arrangements. Thatâs how Trent Johnson wound up at TCU, with abysmal results, and how Frank Haith hopscotched from Miami to Missouri to Tulsa â leaving NCAA investigations behind at the first two programs.</p>","<p>It remains to be seen whether Pitt or Georgia Tech will be better for their new hires. But from surface level, there is nothing to get excited about.</p>","<p><strong>Popular college basketball video on Yahoo Sports:</strong><br><span style=\"\" class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n   <div class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\" style=\"left: 0px; background: #cccccc;\" id=\"ymh-player-iframe\">\n    <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><div class=\"js-video-placeholder RatioBox Bgc-x Bd-0\" data-yepConfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;page_space_id&quot;:&quot;2146234107&quot;,&quot;video_uuid&quot;:&quot;58ba19f0-c742-3bfc-b191-a718d9ddd669&quot;,&quot;device&quot;:&quot;desktop&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;sports&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{&quot;showTitle&quot;:true,&quot;showDescription&quot;:true,&quot;showButton&quot;:true,&quot;showProvider&quot;:false},&quot;width&quot;:640}\"></div></div>\n   </div></span></p>","<p></p>"]},"property":"sports","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"acbddf60-ce47-3084-8bfa-ea5b873bc314","licensed":"true","title":"Trump, Clinton hold double-digit leads in New York","link":"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/trump-clinton-hold-double-digit-1406035520102454.html","summary":"The frontrunners maintain large leads heading into their respective New York primaries next week, recent polls show.

It is a gut-wrenching display,\" he said. \"It is a reminder of the depth of the obligation everyone of us in public life carries ... to create and pursue a world free from nuclear weapons,\" he told a news conference.</p>","<p> After the tour by Kerry and his fellow G7 foreign ministers, the group issued a statement reaffirming their commitment to building a world without nuclear arms but said the push had been made more complex by North Korea's repeated \"provocations\" and by worsening security in Syria and Ukraine.</p>","<p> The ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States laid white wreaths at a cenotaph to the victims of the Aug. 6, 1945, bombing, which reduced the city to ashes and killed some 140,000 people by the end of that year.</p>","<p> While he is not the highest-ranking U.S. official to have toured the museum and memorial park, a distinction that belongs to then-U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in 2008, Kerry is the most senior executive branch official to visit.</p>","<p> ââ\"Everyone in the world should see and feel the power of this memorial. It is a stark, harsh, compelling reminder not only of our obligation to end the threat of nuclear weapons, but to rededicate all our effort to avoid war itself,\" the chief U.S. diplomat wrote in a guest book.</p>","<p> Asked later if this meant Obama should come, Kerry said: \"everyone means everyone. So I hope one day the president of the United States will be among the everyone who is able to come here. Whether or not he can come as president, I donât know.\"</p>","<p> 'FIRST STEP' </p>","<p> At Kerry's suggestion, the ministers also made an impromptu visit to the Atomic Bomb Dome, the skeletal remains of the only structure left standing near the hypocenter of the bomb explosion and now a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> Three days after a U.S. warplane dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, on Aug. 9, 1945. Japan surrendered six days later.</p>","<p> A visit by Obama could be controversial in America if it were viewed as an apology. A majority of Americans view the bombings as justified to end the war and save U.S. lives, while the vast majority of Japanese believe it was not justified.</p>","<p> Hopes for Obama's visit to Hiroshima were raised after an April 2009 speech in Prague when he called for a world without nuclear weapons. He later said that he would be honored to visit the two nuclear-attacked cities. </p>","<p> The G7 foreign ministers' trip to the museum and memorial is part of Japan's effort to send a strong nuclear disarmament message from Hiroshima, the world's first city to suffer atomic bombing.</p>","<p> \"I think this first-ever visit by G7 foreign ministers to the peace memorial park is a historic first step towards reviving momentum toward a world without nuclear weapons,\" Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said in a statement.</p>","<p> He later told a news conference that it was \"inconceivable\" that Japan would ever decide to have nuclear weapons. Last month, U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Japan and South Korea should build such weapons to deter enemies.</p>","<p> In a separate, detailed statement, the G7 ministers singled out North Korea for sharp criticism, condemning its recent nuclear test and launches using ballistic missile technology.</p>","<p> And in a statement on maritime security, they voiced their strong opposition to provocative attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas, an apparent reference to China, which is locked in territorial disputes with other nations including the Philippines, Vietnam and Japan.</p>","<p> (Additional writing by Linda Sieg and additional reporting by Tim Kelly and Elaine Lies in Tokyo; Editing by Michael Perry and Nick Macfie)</p>"]},"property":"news","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","width":"450","ratio":76,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/urlUri7IaJSOSE5_utDaxg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0xO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2016-04-11T054418Z_1_LYNXNPEC3A085_RTROPTP_2_G7-JAPAN.JPG.cf.jpg","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/LC0lHNI5b8teS5ybb6jEfg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz00NTA7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2016-04-11T054418Z_1_LYNXNPEC3A085_RTROPTP_2_G7-JAPAN.JPG.cf.jpg","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[{"caption":"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (2nd L) prepares to lay a wreath at the cenotaph with Japan&#39;s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida (L), Britain&#39;s Foreign Minister Philip Hammond and other fellow G7 foreign ministers at Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and Museum in Hiroshima, Japan, in this photo released by Kyodo April 11, 2016.

[<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/40046-holy-land-archaeological-finds.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">The Holy Land: 7 Amazing Archaeological Finds</a>]</p>","<p> <strong>Biblical history</strong></p>","<p> Religious scholars have long fiercely debated <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/8008-bible-possibly-written-centuries-earlier-text-suggests.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">when the Bible was written</a>. Up until around the middle ages, people believed the Bible was written almost in real-time (as events were occurring).</p>","<p> Text in the Bible mentions scribes and literate officials for the kingdom of Judah, which remained a state from roughly the 10th century B.C. to 586 B.C., when the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar laid waste to Jerusalem, destroyed the temple and forced most of the Jewish elites into exile in Babylonia. So scholars assumed the text must have been written prior to the destruction of the temple. [<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/24323-amazing-ancient-ruins.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">In Photos: Amazing Ruins of the Ancient World</a>]</p>","<p> But that line of reasoning assumed the biblical accounts were historically accurate. Another possibility is that those details about literate people were anachronisms inserted by later writers based on their own cultures, Finkelstein said. In recent years, one camp of scholars has pushed for a later date for the compilation of the Old Testament, with some even arguing the compilation occurred centuries later, when the Greeks or Persians ruled in what is now Israel, Finkelstein said.</p>","<p> He said he and his colleagues realized there might be a different way to address the question. Decades earlier, archeologists had uncovered archaic Hebrew ink inscriptions on ostraca, or pottery shards, from a frontier fort called Arad, a remote garrison located far away from Judah's central city, Jerusalem. Finkelstein said he wondered whether these inscriptions, which were written over the span of a few months in 600 B.C., could reveal how many people could read and write at the time.</p>","<p> <strong>Widespread literacy</strong></p>","<p> To answer that question, Arie Shaus, a mathematics and archaeology doctoral candidate at Tel Aviv University, along with Shira Faigenbaum-Golovin, an applied mathematics doctoral candidate at the university, and colleagues, relied on machine learning. They used computer programs to scan digital images of the text, systematically fill in missing lines of text and analyze each stroke. Finally, the computer algorithms compared the script on each of the 18 inscriptions to see whether they were written by the same hand. (The <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/42398-ark-of-covenant-fate-revealed-in-hebrew-text.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">ancient Hebrew text</a> was written in an Iron Age script that is no longer used.)</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> All told, at least six different people wrote or read the script on the ostracas, including individuals ranging in rank from the commander of the fort, a man named Malkiyahu, all the way down to the deputy quartermaster, a soldier with a low rank, below the person running the fort's storage depots, the researchers reported today (April 11) in the journal <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1522200113\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>. While none of these inscriptions were Shakespeare, most were written with proper spelling and syntax, the researchers found.</p>","<p> \"This is really quite amazing,\" Finkelstein said, \"that in a remote place like this, there was more than one person, several people, who could write.\"</p>","<p> What's more, other border forts have similar ostraca, suggesting that writing at that time was widespread, at least within the Judahite army, the researchers reported. Other archaeological evidence suggests that no more than 100,000 people lived in Judah at the time. Together, these lines of evidence suggest that a substantial fraction of the population (possibly several hundreds of people) could read and write, Finkelstein said.</p>","<p> <strong>Early biblical compilation</strong></p>","<p> In order for so many low-ranking soldiers to be able to read and write, there must have been some kind of Judahite educational system, Finkelstein said. Â </p>","<p> That, in turn, suggests there were enough literate people at that time to compile some portions of the <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/50177-tanakh-old-testament-book.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Old Testament</a>, such as the Book of Deuteronomy, parts of Genesis, and the books of Joshua to 2 Kings, Finkelstein said.</p>","<p> By contrast, after the destruction of the first temple, when Israel's educated people were either killed or exiled to <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/28701-ancient-babylon-center-of-mesopotamian-civilization.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Babylonia</a>, there is not so much as a pottery shard, seal or stamp with a single piece of writing from the region for more than 200 years, Finkelstein said. This suggests it's much less likely these books were compiled after the temple's destruction, he said.</p>","<p> The findings are very important and dovetail with other lines of research, said Christopher Rollston, a Near East scholar at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. There is no doubt that the elites in Judahite society could read and write around 600 B.C., Rollston said.</p>","<p> \"In fact, I have argued in print that the literacy of elites (scribes, high governmental and religious officials) is already present by circa 800 [B.C.]\" Rollston told Live Science in an email.</p>","<p> However, not everyone agrees with all of the paper's assumptions. While the notion that many could read and write in the Kingdom of Judah during the seventh century B.C. is widespread, \"I do not share the authors' opinion that literacy among the elite declined after the seventh century [B.C.],\" said Ernst Axel Knauf, a theology scholar at Bern University in Switzerland, who was not involved in the study.</p>","<p> <em>Follow Tia Ghose on </em><em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/tiaghose\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Twitter</a>Â </em><em>and </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/101897839070491804371/posts\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"><em>Google+</em></a><em>.</em>Â <em>Follow</em>Â <em>Live Science </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveScience\" title=\"http://twitter.com/#!/livescience\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"><em>@livescience</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/#!/livescience\" title=\"http://www.facebook.com/#!/livescience\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"><em>Facebook</em></a>Â <em>& </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/101164570444913213957/posts\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"><em>Google+</em></a><em>.

Nearly half of those homeless are children.</p>","<p> The changes announced on Monday are intended to address the issue in four key areas: preventing at-risk residents from losing their homes, moving homeless out of shelters and into permanent housing, improving conditions at shelters and reducing the number of homeless who sleep in the streets.</p>","<p> \"We know the status quo has not been working,\" de Blasio said at Bronxworks, a nonprofit that helps impoverished families. \"We don't accept that status quo. Today begins a new approach.\"</p>","<p> The number of homeless has more than doubled from around 23,000 two decades ago and has remained stubbornly high, leaving de Blasio's administration open to criticism. New York's large shelter population is in part due to a landmark court case that established a \"right to shelter\" mandate requiring city authorities to provide housing for those without it.</p>","<p> In response, the mayor has proposed spending an additional $66 million dollars to fight the problem, though he said the organizational changes announced on Monday would lead to savings of $38 million to help offset those new costs.</p>","<p> The city's Human Resources Administration and Department of Homeless Services will report to a single commissioner and share administrative duties, de Blasio said, eliminating some bureaucratic redundancies.</p>","<p> The city will use data analytics to identify at-risk families and increase its use of legal assistance and rental aid to avoid evictions.</p>","<p> De Blasio also said the city would conduct more inspections of shelters and crack down on not-for-profit agencies that fail to provide safe and adequate shelters.</p>","<p> The New York City police department is already in the process of retraining so-called peace officers who share security responsibility with private guards at the city's more than 250 shelters.</p>","<p> The city is also reinstating a dormant program that provided domestic violence services in shelters, after the review found 60 percent of violent episodes in family shelters were due to domestic violence.</p>","<p> The issue gained more attention in February, when a homeless woman and two of her young children were stabbed to death at a hotel used by the city to house homeless families.
