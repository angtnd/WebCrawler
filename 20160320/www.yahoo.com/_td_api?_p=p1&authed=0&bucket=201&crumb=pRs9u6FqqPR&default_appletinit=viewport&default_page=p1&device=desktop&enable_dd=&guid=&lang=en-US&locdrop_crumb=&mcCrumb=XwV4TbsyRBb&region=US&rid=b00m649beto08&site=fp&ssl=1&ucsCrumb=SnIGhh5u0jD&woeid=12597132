And it was family, friends and petty criminals who helped him evade a manhunt for four months before he was arrested on Friday in the neighborhood he grew up in, not far from his parents' home.</p>","<p> As security services seek to understand how Islamic State operates in Europe to prevent more attacks, Abdeslam's case highlights the difficulty of tracking suspects who can rely on the protection of community networks, many of which do not involve religious radicals and are not on the police radar.</p>","<p> \"Abdeslam relied on a large network of friends and relatives that already existed for drug dealing and petty crime to keep him in hiding,\" Belgium's federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said of the only surviving suspect of the Nov. 13 attacks that killed 130 people in Paris.</p>","<p> \"This was about the solidarity of neighbors, families,\" Van Leeuw told public broadcaster RTBF, speaking about Abdeslam's ability to hide for so long despite 24,000 calls from the public to a Belgian police hotline seeking information about the suspected attackers.</p>","<p> Abdeslam may have been hidden in the basement of an apartment of the mother of a friend with no links to militants, Belgian newspaper La Libre Belgique reported on Sunday.</p>","<p> Such friendships, not Islamic State operatives, proved crucial from the start for Abdeslam, who ran a bar in Molenbeek with his brother, which was a nexus of social life for young Arab men with little interest in the mosque but was shut down shortly before the attacks for being a hub for drug dealing.</p>","<p> Abdeslam relied on two friends to drive him back to Brussels after his brother Brahim blew himself up at a Paris cafe. Others drove him around Molenbeek and its environs between safe houses. </p>","<p> Police, who were eventually able to move in to seize him at a house in the rundown North African neighborhood of Molenbeek, have charged a man and a women whom they suspect of being part of a family who harbored the fugitive.</p>","<p> While Abdeslam's networks were not infallible - his call to an acquaintance for help looking for a new hiding place let police finally locate him - they were formidable.</p>","<p> 'IT'S NOT OVER'</p>","<p> Few residents would talk to Reuters about Abdeslam, a 26-year-old French citizen raised by Moroccan-born parents in Molenbeek, on the poorer side of the city's industrial-era canal.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> Most of those that did said he was a likeable guy who was known in the area.</p>","<p> Dominique, who ran a newsagents close to where Abdeslam was arrested, described him as \"a very nice boy\" who showed no signs of becoming a radical. Abdeslam did not fight in Syria.</p>","<p> \"I won't say he was normal because everyone always say that, but he had a nice manner, he wasn't aggressive,\" said Molenbeek resident Pierre, in his 50s.</p>","<p> But another Molenbeek resident, Henri, meanwhile warned that Abdeslam was not the only one attracted by radicalism in the area. \"It's not over,\" he said. \"There are a lot of them.\"</p>","<p> Western fighters in Syria and Iraq have found some of their most willing recruits in Belgium, partly because of the frustration many jobless young men feel in the marginalized quarters of Brussels - just a few kilometers from the wealth and power of the headquarters of NATO and the European Union, but effectively a world away.</p>","<p> Belgium has supplied the highest per capita number of fighters to Syria of any European nation. More than 300 Belgians have gone to take up arms in Syria and Iraq, according to an estimate from the Brussels-based Egmont think-tank.</p>","<p> Radicals such as another Molenbeek man Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected planner of the Paris attacks who was killed by French police late last year, posted internet videos of his exploits as a foreign fighter in Syria.</p>","<p> 'PEOPLE WORK FREELANCE'</p>","<p> But while three of the Paris attacks suspects grew up in Brussels, not all radicalized Belgian militants head for Syria.</p>","<p> They are part of \"networks and accomplices\" who have not attracted police attention, according to Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders and who vowed to extend surveillance. </p>","<p> Some sell drugs and weapons in an area where locals have a reputation for not cooperating with police, doing only part-time work for Islamic State such as recruiting fighters to go to Syria and helping to plan attacks, Belgian prosecutors said. </p>","<p> That would suggest police work cannot be focused simply on city mosques or monitoring social media and intercepting intelligence from militants in Syria and Iraq. </p>","<p> \"I don't think Daesh is giving orders 24 hours a day. That would make it too easy for us,\" said prosecutor Van Leeuw, referring to the militant group by its Arabic acronym. \"People work freelance.\"</p>","<p> Such complexity has prompted European police chiefs to urge governments to focus on the links between political militants and organized crime - noting, for example, that financing for militant groups has often come from drug dealing and racketeering while established crime gangs probably supplied the Kalashnikovs favored in recent IS attacks.</p>","<p> Counter-terrorism expert Rik Coolsaet said that spotting Islamic State recruits in Europe was also becoming more difficult because, unlike in the past, youngsters were less likely to be pious conservatives but rather secular rebels who feel they have no part in society and are disillusioned by a perceived lack of opportunity.</p>","<p> Following the worst financial crisis in a generation and with few of the lower-skilled jobs their parents' generation enjoyed in Belgian car factories and coal mines remaining, there is a \"no-future atmosphere\" said Coolsaet, from the Egmont think-tank.</p>","<p> \"Joining Islamic State opens a thrilling, bigger-than-life dimension to their way of life. For most of them it is akin to street gangs, drug trafficking, juvenile delinquency,\" he said.</p>","<p> \"A journey to Utopia.\"</p>","<p> (Additional reporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Pravin Char)</p>"]},"property":"news","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"e829db1b-2793-3e0b-acfa-83ad60ac5b4c","licensed":"true","title":"Spain: 13 students killed, 34 injured in highway bus crash","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/spain-killed-injured-bus-crash-coastal-highway-100030812.html","summary":"MADRID (AP) â A bus carrying university exchange students back from Spain&#39;s largest fireworks festival crashed Sunday on a main highway in the northeastern, killing at least 13 passengers and injuring 34 others, officials said.","entities":"WIKIID:Spain|WIKIID:Ministry_for_the_Press_and_the_Media","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000798|YCT:001000780|YCT:001000992","publisher":"Associated Press","author":"HAROLD HECKLE","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/DuBQWBKPA4y5Oei3EAmwGA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://l.yimg.com/os/152/2012/04/21/image001-png_162613.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://www.ap.org/","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"7665154","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","enable_lead":"default","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"7665154","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Spain;Ministry_for_the_Press_and_the_Media;Student;Generalitat_de_Catalunya;Barcelona;Bus_driver;Government;Valencia\" ctopid=\"1106000;1996000;18857489;18859489\" hashtag=\"1106000;1996000;18857489;18859489\" rs=\"lmsid:a077000000IpoJiAAJ;revsp:ap.org;lpstaid:e829db1b-2793-3e0b-acfa-83ad60ac5b4c\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"embedded_images":{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/9714ccaf7e67b30e930f6a706700249e.jpg"},"lead_video":{"id":"0c3ffc50-f0f5-38c9-8b8c-87f330cfb5ae","title":"At least 14 dead in Spanish bus crash","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/video/least-14-dead-spanish-bus-121106892.html","published":"2016-03-20T14:00:16Z","summary":"A bus carrying 56 university students from across Europe has crashed while traveling between Valencia and Barcelona in eastern Spain, killing at least 14 people.

Four ACC teams advanced to the Sweet 16 on Saturday and Notre Dame and Syracuse have a chance to join the party if they can dispatch of 14th-seeded Stephen F. Austin and 15th-seeded Middle Tennessee on Sunday. Granted the NCAA tournament's small sample size isn't a good barometer of league strength and that Duke, Miami, North Carolina and Virginia all advanced without facing better than a No. 9 seed, but that's still impressive. Of the ACC's seven NCAA tournament entrants, only Pittsburgh has been eliminated thus far.</p>","<p><strong>2.</strong> The ACC team that had to work the hardest to advance was Virginia, which thwarted Butler's upset bid with a 77-69 victory fueled by an incredible display of offensive efficiency. The slow-paced Cavaliers scored 54 second-half points and shot 19 of 26 from the field after halftime. At one point late in the second half, Virginia had missed only five shots and had scored via offensive rebounds on three of them. The Cavaliers needed every one of those baskets because Butler enjoyed enough success of its own to stay close the entire second half. Only a blown call on a Roosevelt Jones block in the final minute kept the Bulldogs from having a chance to tie down three.</p>","<p><strong>3.Â </strong>Kentucky's second-round loss to Indiana looked a lot like many of the Wildcats' worst performances this season. An erratic frontcourt didn't perform up to expectations, Jamal Murray needed 18 shots to score 16 points and brilliant as Tyler Ulis was, he could not carry the team to victory by himself. It seemed Kentucky was turning the corner late in the season when Derek Willis entered the starting lineup and Skal Labissiere's flashes of potential became more frequent, but this was a harsh reminder that the Wildcats never achieved consistency. That the reminder came at the hands of the rival Hoosiers only made it sting more.Â </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p><strong>4.</strong> Only two weeks ago, Gonzaga needed to win the WCC tournament to avoid the NIT. Now the Zags are a win over either Syracuse or Middle Tennessee away from the program's second straight Elite Eight. Gonzaga earned Mark Few's sixth Sweet 16 appearance with a 82-59 throttling of Utah on Saturday. Domantas Sabonis thoroughly outplayed fellow elite big man Jakob Poeltl and Kyle Wiltjer scored an efficient 17 points, but the key to Gonzaga's victory was the continued improvement of its guards. Eric McClellan scored 22 points and the rest of his teammates sank open threes and made good decisions with the ball.</p>","<p><strong>5. </strong>Utah's meltdown against Gonzaga has the Pac-12's NCAA tournament teetering between disappointment and disaster. Of the league's seven teams that earned a bid, only top-seeded Oregon still has a chance to advance to the Sweet 16. You can make excuses for Cal (injuries) or Arizona (nightmare draw), but there's no reason the Utes shouldn't have been competitive against Gonzaga. Something Larry Krystkowiak will have to analyze during the offseason is why his team this season tended to fold against good teams anytime adversity struck. The Utes lost by 24 to Miami, by 17 to Wichita State, by 18 and 31 to Oregon and now by 23 to the Zags.</p>","<p><strong>BEST PASS</strong></p>","<span class=\"yui-tweet yui-editorial-embed\">\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n  <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">OH.

Sale and Eatonâs talk of the clubhouse being unified and Williamsâ nodding about the âbondingâ of the clubhouse over all of this didnât make sense. Rather, <a href=\"http://mlb.nbcsports.com/2016/03/17/the-white-sox-considered-boycotting-yesterdays-game-over-the-adam-laroche-situation/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">I and many others surmised</a>, this was likely a situation in which White Sox players â maybe several of them â complained to Ken Williams about Drake LaRocheâs presence and Ken Williams (a) was doing their bidding in limiting/barring Drake LaRocheâ and (b) took the heat for it so there was not a clubhouse rift. Occamâs Razor suggested that this was the more likely situation, no matter what the official line was.</p>","<p>Occamâs Razor did not fail us. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/bob-nightengale/2016/03/18/adam-laroche-drake-laroche-kenny-williams/81993428/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Bob Nightengale of USA Today reports</a>:</p>","<blockquote> \n <p>. . . while the early evidenceÂ framesÂ this as a Williams vs. LaRoche battle over clubhouse time for LaRocheâs son, multiple baseball officials with direct knowledge of the Adam LaRoche brouhaha told USA TODAY Sports a different tale.</p> \n <p>Several players and staff members privately complained to White Sox management recently about the constant presence of LaRocheâs 14-year-old son, Drake, in the clubhouse.</p> \n</blockquote>","<p>While one may be tempted to say this doesnât much matter now because LaRoche is gone, the fact is that the behavior of all of the parties in the past few days makes this a pretty big deal.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p><a href=\"http://mlb.nbcsports.com/2016/03/17/the-white-sox-considered-boycotting-yesterdays-game-over-the-adam-laroche-situation/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">There was a heated team meeting about this on Tuesday</a>. A meeting Chris Sale said presented a White Sox team entirely on the same page regarding the LaRoches. So much so that a boycott of Wednesdayâs spring training game was considered. In the following days <a href=\"http://mlb.nbcsports.com/2016/03/18/the-white-sox-clubhouse-is-blowing-up-over-the-adam-laroche-situation/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Sale accused Ken Williams of lying</a> when he said that players or coaches complained and he hung up the LaRochesâ jerseys in his locker. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BNightengale/status/711330694748704771\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">The team kept Drake LaRocheâs nameplate up on his locker</a> in his memory. Yesterday Adam Eaton talked about how <a href=\"http://mlb.nbcsports.com/2016/03/19/adam-eaton-we-lost-a-leader-in-drake/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Drake LaRoche was a team leader</a>, for crying out loud.</p>","<p>Now Sale and Eaton â and, one presumes, some other players for whom they were speaking â know that what they initially believedÂ was not true. They now know that there was not unanimous acceptance of Drake LaRoche. At the very best the Sale-Eaton contingent have to be embarrassed at how far out on the limb they got on this, portraying clubhouse ambivalence as clubhouse unity. More concerning, however, is that the Sale-Eaton contingent may now feel as though their teammates lied to them. Either by voicing disingenuous support for the LaRoches while they secretly complained or by keeping silent and allowing that impression to be created.</p>","<p>There will be some tempted to play the role of savvy cynic and say âeh, Sale and Eaton probably knew others complained and were just being dramatic.â I think thatâs pretty unlikely. To say the things they said and to act in the manner they did â remember, they were talking about boycotting a game over this â while knowing that others in the clubhouse didnât agree with them would itself be an act of clubhouse dissension. Theyâd be publicly rubbing their teammatesâ noses in the matter and passive-aggressively calling them out. Thatâs not something players would do lightly or easily. No, I believe they took the stance that they did because they truly believed they were in an us (players) against him (Ken Williams) situation. I believe that <em>they</em> believed that no uniformed White Sox personnel had an issue with Drake LaRoche. Remember, when Ken Williams privately suggested that to Sale, Sale accused him of lying.</p>","<p>They have now found out they were wrong.

Later, I was told not to bring him to the ballpark at all. Obviously, I expressed my displeasure toward this decision to alter the agreement we had reached before I signed with the White Sox. Upon doing so, I had to make a decision,â he continued. \"Do I choose my teammates and my career? Or do I choose my family? The decision was easy, but in no way was it a reflection of how I feel about my teammates, manager, general manager or the clubâs owner Jerry Reinsdorf. The White Sox organization is full of people with strong values and solid character. My decision to walk away was simply the result of a fundamental disagreement between myself and Ken Williams.â</p>","<p><a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/celebrity-feuds-the-biggest-ever-2013224?utm_source=yahoocelebrity&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">PHOTOS: Celebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever!</a></p>","<p><span style=\"\">LaRoche concluded his statement with advice he said he gave his teammates: âIn life, weâre all faced with difficult decisions and will have a choice to make.
