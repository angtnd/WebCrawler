Francis' first post is of the Pope himself kneeling in prayer with the caption \"Pray for me\" written in nine different languages.Â </p>","<p>âInstagram will help recount the papacy through images, to enable all those who wish to accompany and know more about Pope Francisâ pontificate to encounter his gestures of tenderness and mercy,â Dario E. ViganÃ², prefect of the Vaticanâs Secretariat for Communications, said in a <a href=\"http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2016/03/18/160318b.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">press release</a> Friday. âWe will choose photographs from the Photographic Service of LâOsservatore Romano, selecting certain details. In this way we can show those aspects of closeness and inclusion that Pope Francis lives every day.âÂ </p>","<p>The Popeâs social media presence is as remarkable for the leader of the historically traditional Roman Catholic Church as it is for any 79-year-old. And social media seems to love him right back. <a href=\"https://popevisit2015.yahoo.com/post/129671911849/social-media-welcomes-pope-francis-to-the-united\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">In honor of his visit</a> to the United States this fall, Twitter released a batch of limited edition of Pope emojis, while Snapchat offered users in the cities Francis visited the opportunity to stamp their snaps with Pontiff-themed filtersÂ </p>","<p>Â In fact, Francis reportedly decided to expand his social media horizons after meeting with Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom at the Vatican last month. Naturally, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BCP_SbOgBDr/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Systrom documented the meeting</a> via Instagram, writing in the caption of his post, âToday I had the honor of meeting Pope Francis.

Here's a look at some of the biggest storylines heading into Saturday's action:</em></p>","<p><strong>1. Which No. 1 seed is in the most jeopardy of a second-round knockout?</strong></p>","<p>Of the three No. 1 seeds in action on Saturday, Virginia may have both the most to lose and the most dangerous matchup. The Cavaliers face a Butler team with an efficient offense, a level of comfort playing at a methodical pace and a history of pulling seismic upsets.</p>","<p>A loss Saturday would be devastating for Virginia because the Cavaliers have a golden opportunity with March nemesis Michigan State no longer a Midwest Region road block. Now a Final Four berth is Virginia's to lose, and seldom has the Cavaliers program ever been able to say that.</p>","<p>Neither of the other two No. 1 seeds have free paths to the Sweet 16, though. Providence will test North Carolina by repeatedly putting its big men in ball screens and UConn, which faces Kansas, inevitably seems to rise to the occasion in March. The Huskies are 17-2 in the NCAA tournament since 2009.</p>","<p><strong>2. Will fatigue impact Wichita State?</strong></p>","<p>If you're curious what govern the NCAA tournament, Wichita State's tip-off time on Saturday should answer that question. CBS has decreed that the Shockers will play Miami in the earliest game even though that puts Wichita State at a disadvantage after already playing in the First Four on Tuesday night and in the first round on Thursday night.</p>","<p>\"Miami got a little bit more rest than we did,\" Wichita State coach Gregg Marshall said. \"I would obviously prefer the game to be a little later. We've played 9:10, 9:20, and now we bump it up to the first game of the day, noon tomorrow. But again, they didn't ask me. They didn't really care for my opinion.\"</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>CBS/Turner typically selects a regional with two fairly compelling matchups for the early time slots in the second round because there are no other games going on at the same time. Why the networks chose the Providence Regional is anyone's guess, however, both Wichita State-Miami and Duke-Yale are fun matchups.</p>","<p>How concerned with fatigue is Marshall? Enough that Wichita State spent Friday resting and doing mostly film work.</p>","<p>\"We'll have to practice a little bit, do some walk-through,\" Marshall said. 'Very light for the guys that played a lot of minutes yesterday in practice. But there will be some guys that get up and down a little bit just to try to keep their conditioning because who knows when some guy who hadn't been playing much will be called on and need to execute for us.\"</p>","<p><strong><span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1458391535034\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Right\"><img title=\"Head coach Tom Crean of the Indiana Hoosiers.

Why is Kentucky vs. Indiana the most compelling game of the day?</strong></p>","<p>The Kentucky-Indiana matchup is especially intriguing because of the way their rivalry abruptly ended in 2012 after the two teams met at least once a season the previous 44 years.</p>","<p>John Calipari wanted to stop playing home-and-home and play at a neutral site, preferably Indianapolis' Lucas Oil Stadium. He knew his rabid fan base would travel, he liked the idea of preparing to play in a dome before a potential Final Four and it didn't hurt that he'd never have to play at Assembly Hall again.</p>","<p>Tom Crean preferred the matchup rotate between the two campus sites the way it most recently had. The Hoosiers had defeated Kentucky's 2012 national championship squad in Bloomington, and probably had a much better chance for success in the series with their students in the building every two years.</p>","<p>Neither coach would budge from his position, so college basketball has suffered. There's no plans to restart the series anytime soon, so Saturday's game is not just for a spot in the Sweet 16 but for regional bragging rights for years to come.</p>","<p>\"I understand they need home games and that's what they want,\" Calipari said. \"There is no issue with me. We've got our schedule. They've got theirs. It hasn't hurt, us and it hasn't hurt them.\"</p>","<p><strong>4. Which elite big man will shine brightest in Gonzaga-Utah?</strong></p>","<p>When the Zags and Utes tip off on Saturday, the teams top big men will be the center of attention.</p>","<p>On one side is Domantas Sabonis, a skilled yet physical 6-foot-11 forward from Lithuania with a lethal mid-range game and a ferocity and grit about him. On the other side is Jakob Poeltl, a true 7-foot center who scores with his back to the basket and protects the rim with his ability to alter shots.</p>","<p>Poeltl is considered a potential lottery pick. Sabonis could go in the first round of the draft as soon as this June too.</p>","<p>The stakes are even higher now that Michigan State has been eliminated from the Midwest Bracket. Now the winner of Utah and Gonzaga will likely be the favorite in the next round against either Syracuse or Middle Tennessee.</p>","<p><strong>5. Which 12 seed has the better chance to advance to the second weekend?</strong></p>","<p>Twenty times since the bracket expanded to 64 teams in 1985, a No. 12 seed has made the Sweet 16. Only once has two made it in the same year, however, so it's probably unlikely both Yale and Arkansas-Little Rock survive second-round matchups on Saturday.</p>","<p>Which has more hope of springing another upset? Probably Little Rock. Its methodical pace and top 30 defense will challenge free-flowing, high-scoring Iowa State, though the Cyclones are better equipped to handle it than first-round opponent Purdue was. Whereas Purdue lacked a capable point guard, Iowa State's Monte Morris is one of the elite distributors nationally.</p>","<p>\"I hope our guard play ... gives us an ability to handle their pressure better,\" Iowa State coach Steve Prohm told reporters in Denver. \"We don't have the size of Purdue. But we can space the floor. We can spread you out. We can do some different things offensively that Purdue may not be able to do.\"</p>","<p>Yale probably lacks the perimeter quickness to give Duke's backcourt fits, but the Bulldogs' rebounding prowess at both ends of the floor could be problematic. When Duke pulled away in the second half of the first meeting en route to a comfortable victory, that was still back when the Blue Devils had Amile Jefferson available. They're smaller now and playing more zone, which has made them more vulnerable on the glass.</p>","<p id=\"yui-tmp-10\" style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"Ta-c \"><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><em>- - - - - - -</em></span></p>","<p><strong><a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/author/jeff-eisenberg/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Jeff Eisenberg</a></strong> is the editor of <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaab-the-dagger/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"><strong>The Dagger</strong></a> on Yahoo Sports.

The disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion led to the convoluted scenarios laid out in â<a href=\"https://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/ir/pdf/ChurchIR_3B_Cuba.pdf\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Operation Mongoose</a>,â including plots to poison Fidel with a cigar, or a wet suit, or hiring organized crime figures to kill him.

Naming an ambassador, Obama aides say privately, would pack too many risks and too few rewards. It would not alter the day-to-day diplomatic work, while embroiling the White House in yet another battle with Republicans in Congress. And failure to win confirmation would deal a sharp symbolic blow to Obamaâs policy. </p>","<p> Obama still seeks ambitious changes on both sides of the Florida Straits. In the United States, he wants Congress to lift the embargo. In Cuba, he wants the government to take its own big steps, like allowing American businesses to hire directly, bypassing the patronage system that helps Castro hold on to power. </p>","<p> âA real game changer would be a situation in which you have a direct employer-employee relationship,â Obama told Yahoo News in December. </p>","<p>Cubaâs government, though hungry for foreign investment, has not eagerly embraced the idea of political change.

recognizes the need for change,â and wants to âhelp usher in those changes before he and his brother are gone,â leaving a successor without the clout to transform Cuba either politically or economically. </p>","<p> After all, Obama said, ânobodyâs got better street cred when it comes to, you know, Cuban revolutionary zeal than one of the original revolutionaries.â

(Photo: David J. Phillip/AP)</i><br /></p>","<p>A Cruz presidency could set the United States on a very different trajectory within hours â if he can make good on his many promises for change on Day One. </p>","<p>Throughout his campaign, GOP presidential hopeful and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has outlined the actions he plans to take on his first day in the Oval Office if he is elected president.</p>","<p>Mainstream America first heard this list during Cruzâs closing statement at this election cycleâs first Republican presidential debate, on Aug. 6.</p>","<p>âIf I am elected president, let me tell you about my first day in office,â he said at the Fox News debate. The list included overturning President Obamaâs executive orders, canceling the Iran deal and ordering the Department of Justice to investigate Planned Parenthood, among many other things.</p>","<p>Though extreme, these plans were somewhat drowned out by the sheer number of candidates crowding onto the GOP stage â and billionaire businessman Donald Trumpâs braggadocio.</p>","<p>Cruzâs recitation of his Day One plans has become a staple in his speeches and town hall meetings, where heâs further fleshed out the list. </p>","<p>Now that the primaries have winnowed out most of last summerâs Republican contenders â only Cruz, Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich remain â itâs worth returning to Cruzâs plans.</p>","<p>To discuss the likelihood that Cruz could actually deliver all he has promised, Yahoo News reached out to law professors Amanda Frost and Stephen Vladeck from American University Washington College of Law, and law professor Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina School of Law. </p>","<p>âLegally, I think some of it is feasible. Practically, these are all going to be pretty darn heavy lifts for the first day,â Vladeck said. âA lot of the stuff heâs discussing are actions that the executive branch can pursue unilaterally, but probably not in 15 hours.â</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Hereâs the busy schedule Cruz set up for himself for his first day at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue â and legal takes on whether these plans are doable. </p>","<p><b>Overturn Obamaâs executive orders: Possible, but more difficult with established regulations â and not on Day One</b></p>","<p><i>âThe first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama.â (Aug. 6, 2015; GOP debate)</i></p>","<p>An executive order can overrule an executive order. </p>","<p>The law scholars agree that Cruz would be able to reverse or modify Obamaâs executive orders under the Constitution. But practically speaking, itâs hard to change a law thatâs already on the books.</p>","<p>âIn theory, yes, a new president can reverse things that arenât at the level of legislation that a previous president has done,â Frost said. âBut in fact, there are a lot of bureaucratic hurdles that need to be jumped through.â</p>","<p>If an executive order resulted in some sort of formal regulation, Cruz would need to convince the agency that promulgated that regulation to go through a process of repealing or withdrawing it. This could happen fairly quickly, but itâs not likely to occur on Day One.</p>","<p><b>Order Department of Justice to investigate Planned Parenthood: Possibly illegal</b></p>","<p><i>âThe next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations.â (Aug. 6, 2015; GOP debate)</i></p>","<p>According to Gerhardt, the president of the United States is not allowed to direct particular prosecutions or investigations; the president can set policies and priorities or appoint people who share his or her values, but may not direct the DOJ to go after individuals or organizations. </p>","<p>âThat is completely illegal.

It is a privilege I have greatly valued. I have never taken it for granted, and I feel an enormous amount of gratitude toward both of those organizations.</em><br /><br /><em>Though I clearly indicated to both teams the importance of having my son with me, I also made clear that if there was ever a moment when a teammate, coach or manager was made to feel uncomfortable, then I would immediately address it. I realize that this is their office and their career, and it would not be fair to the team if anybody in the clubhouse was unhappy with the situation. Fortunately, that problem never developed. Im not going to speak about my son Drakes behavior, his manners, and the quality of person that he is, because everyone knows that I am biased. All of the statements from my teammates, past and present, should say enough. Those comments from all of the people who have interacted with Drake are a testimony to how he carries himself.</em><br /><br /><em>Prior to signing with the White Sox, my first question to the club concerned my sons ability to be a part of the team. After some due diligence on the clubs part, we reached an agreement. The 2015 season presented no problems as far as Drake was concerned. (My bat and our record are another story!)</em><br /><br /><em>With all of this in mind, we move toward the current situation which arose after White Sox VP Ken Williams recently advised me to significantly scale back the time that my son spent in the clubhouse. Later, I was told not to bring him to the ballpark at all. Obviously, I expressed my displeasure toward this decision to alter the agreement we had reached before I signed with the White Sox. Upon doing so, I had to make a decision. Do I choose my teammates and my career? Or do I choose my family? The decision was easy, but in no way was it a reflection of how I feel about my teammates, manager, general manager or the clubs owner Jerry Reinsdorf.</em><br /><br /><em>The White Sox organization is full of people with strong values and solid character. My decision to walk away was simply the result of a fundamental disagreement between myself and Ken Williams.</em><br /><br /><em>I understand that many people will not understand my decision. I respect that, and all I ask is for that same level of respect in return. I live by certain values that are rooted in my faith, and I am grateful to my parents for that. I have tried to set a good example on and off the field and live a life that represents these values. As fathers, we have an opportunity to help mold our kids into men and women of character, with morals and values that cant be shaken by the world around them. Of one thing I am certain: we will regret NOT spending enough time with our kids, not the other way around.</em><br /><br /><em>At every level of my career, the game of baseball has reinforced the importance of family to me. Being at my fathers side when he coached. Playing alongside my brothers as a kid and as an adult in the big leagues.</em><br /><br /><em>Likewise, it has been great to have my son by my side to share in this experience as I played.</em><br /><br /><em>In each and every instance, baseball has given me some of my lifes greatest memories. This was likely to be the last year of my career, and theres no way I was going to spend it without my son.</em><br /><br /><em>Baseball has taught me countless life lessons. Ive learned how to face challenges, how to overcome failure, how to maintain humility, and most importantly, to trust that the Lord is in control and that I was put here to do more than play the game of baseball. We are called to live life with an unwavering love for God and love for each other. These are lessons I try to teach my kids every day. I truly am blessed to have been granted each of those experiences.</em><br /><br /><em>Thank you to all of my previous managers, past teammates and friends across the league for making these past 12 years such a wonderful journey, and for providing me with memories that I will never forget--especially the ones with my son by my side.</em><br /><br /><em>I will leave you with the same advice that I left my teammates. In life, were all faced with difficult decisions and will have a choice to make. Do we act based on the consequences, or do we act on what we know and believe in our hearts to be right? I choose the latter.</em></p>"],"remaining_body":["<p><em>- Adam</em></p>"]},"property":"sports"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"3ce091c8-9764-3ce8-ba9b-1296617c58bb","licensed":"true","title":"âReal Housewives of New Jerseyâ Star Jacqueline Lauritaâs Daughter Ashlee Holmes Is Pregnant!","link":"https://celebrity.yahoo.com/news/real-housewives-jersey-star-jacqueline-135533187.html","summary":"âReal Housewives of New Jerseyâ star Jacqueline Lauritaâs daughter Ashlee Holmes announced her pregnancy via Instagram on Friday, March 18, excitedly telling fans she and her fiance are expecting âa little kernelâ of their own â read more","entities":"WIKIID:The_Real_Housewives_of_New_Jersey|WIKIID:The_Real_Housewives","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000031|YCT:001000069|YCT:001000075|YCT:001000086","publisher":"Us Weekly","author":"","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/HkMKWpK1LFH1kGj4bk89xg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://media.zenfs.com/423/2011/07/06/us-logo-pink-106_102336.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://www.usmagazine.com/","site":"omg","region":"us","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"2115829161","propertyRegion":"YPROP:omg","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"2115829161","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"The_Real_Housewives_of_New_Jersey;The_Real_Housewives\" ctopid=\"1035500;1104500;1878000;10610989;1094000\" hashtag=\"1035500;1104500;1878000;10610989;1094000\" rs=\"lmsid:a097000000WBOW7AAP;revsp:usmagazine.com;lpstaid:3ce091c8-9764-3ce8-ba9b-1296617c58bb\"","site":"omg","region":"us","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"3 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo Celebrity","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000031","score":"0.987952","label":"Arts & Entertainment"},{"term":"YCT:001000069","score":"0.986607","label":"Celebrities"},{"term":"YCT:001000075","score":"0.75","label":"Media"},{"term":"YCT:001000086","score":"0.708333","label":"Television"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>And the good news just keeps coming. <i>Real Housewives of New Jersey</i> star <b>Jacqueline Laurita</b>âs daughter <b>Ashlee Holmes</b> announced that she and her fiancÃ©, <b>Pete Malleo</b>, are expecting their first child together via a cute Instagram post on Friday, March 18.</p>","<p>âHad so much fun at @thelittlekernel launch party tonight!!â she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BDHsC6MwzJl/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">captioned a sweet snapshot</a> of the two of them on the red carpet. â@c3peteo and I are so happy to announce that weâre sprouting a little kernel of our own *coming this fall*!!!â</p>","<p><a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/before-they-were-real-housewives-201278?utm_source=yahoocelebrity&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">PHOTOS: Before They Were Real Housewives!</a></p>","<p><span style=\"\">The reality star topped off her caption with a baby and a heart emoji.</span><br /></p>","<p>Laurita, 45, reposted her daughterâs photo a few minutes later, confirming the happy news.</p>","<p>âYes, thatâs right!

The study found that participants who had breakfast cereal and soft drinks sitting on their counters weighed significantly more.</p> <p>So exactly how much does displayingÂ a box of Lucky Charms or bottle of Coke affect weight? According to the study, participants who had cereal on their counters weighed an average of 20 pounds more than their neighbors who didnât set out cereal. Those who had soft drinks on their counters weighed an average of 24 toÂ 26 pounds more than those who didnât. DespiteÂ those jaw-dropping statistics, the study found some uplifting information: Participants who had fruit on their countersÂ weighed,Â on average, 13 pounds less.</p> <p>This shows that a major weight issue can be tied not to having snacks in general, but to what kind of snacks you have on your counters.Â According to the study, âInstead of encouraging dieting, some health professionals are helping their patients understand how factors in their eating environments such as their homes may lead them to overeat, and how they can change these environments to help them effortlessly eat less.â</p> <p>Lead author, Brian Wansink, professor and director of the Cornell Food and Brand lab, explains further, âItâs your basic See-Food Diet â you eat what you see. As a cereal lover, that shocked me. Cereal has a health-halo, but if you eat a handful every time you walk by, itâs not going to make you skinny.â</p> <p>This researchÂ shows that it is a lot easier to maintain or lose weight if sugary drinks andÂ salty snacks arenât visible at all times. By keeping your counters stocked with healthier snacks you have better chances ofÂ making healthier choicesÂ and being more satisfied.</p> <p>âInstead of encouraging dieting, some health professionals are helping their patients understand how factors in their eating environments such as their homes may lead them to overeat, and how they can change these environments to help them effortlessly eat less,â Wansink said.</p> <p>Understanding what and how much you need to eat is an important first step to losing weight. After all, as the saying goes, you really canât out-exercise an unhealthy diet.</p> More from Health & Fitness Cheat Sheet: \n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/life/can-protein-powder-be-bad-for-your-health.html/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Can Protein Powder Be Bad for Your Health?</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/7-foods-that-are-healthier-than-supplements.html/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">7 Foods That Are Healthier Than Dietary Supplements</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/life/10-ways-to-better-health-in-one-minute-or-less.html/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">10 Ways to Better Health, in One Minute or Less</a></li> \n </ul></p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"c43fe618-bb2b-3089-954c-329017628267","licensed":"true","title":"Russell Crowe Opens Up About 52-Pound Weight Loss","link":"https://gma.yahoo.com/russell-crowe-opens-52-pound-weight-loss-203339556--abc-news-celebrities.html","summary":"Russell Crowe is speaking out about his recent weight loss journey.

Speaking in a Mauldin Economics video, Friedman says the Russian deployment was part of an elaborate USâRussia negotiation. The real issue is further north.
