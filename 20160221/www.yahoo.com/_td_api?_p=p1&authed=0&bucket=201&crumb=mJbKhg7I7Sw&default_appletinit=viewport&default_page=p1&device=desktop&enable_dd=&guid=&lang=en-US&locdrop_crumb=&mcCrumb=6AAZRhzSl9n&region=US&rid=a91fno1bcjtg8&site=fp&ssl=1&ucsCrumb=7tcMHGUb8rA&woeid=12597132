There has been no U.S. recall since VW was outed in September for installing cheat software, although the company is negotiating privately with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice, which filed a formal suit against VW earlier this week.","publisher":"Road & Track"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bC3TN1t6R990WntzsHN_aQ--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://l.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150924/VW_emissions.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"640","height":"360"}},{"followId":"ade50c68-5e35-11e5-855e-fa163e2c24a6","name":"U.S.-Cuba relations","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"80df76a6-718d-3159-80a7-310179c120f5","cluster_id":"ade50c68-5e35-11e5-855e-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Obama stops short of agreeing to meet with dissidents in Cuba","link":"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/obama-promises-to-raise-human-rights-questions-on-155207176.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1280","height":"953","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_Z2FJKKuw0HnAurngOsUbA--/aD05NTM7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-2070127756.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0eHX8dZwD_RitkND.YSpyg--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-2070127756.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_nyp2kFGrEPxkzJCYLGVHg--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-2070127756.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-18T19:28:50Z","summary":"President Obama promised to raise human rights concerns when he makes a historic trip to Cuba in March but stopped short of explicitly promising to meet with pro-democracy dissidents. âWe still have differences with the Cuban government that I will raise directly.\"","publisher":"Olivier Knox, Yahoo News"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JPbFZA9q42fUyHQ2F_Ia4g--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://l.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150923/US-Cuba_relations_copy.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"640","height":"360"}},{"followId":"6ad7c03e-c913-11e5-a07a-fa163e2c24a6","name":"Virginia teen slaying","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"700c410c-c948-3bd0-832a-0277113d1842","cluster_id":"6ad7c03e-c913-11e5-a07a-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Search Warrants Sealed in Case of Slain Virginia 13-Year-Old","link":"http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/search-warrants-sealed-case-slain-virginia-13-year-37025075","published":"2016-02-18T15:06:29Z","summary":"Search warrants in the death of a 13-year-old girl who police say was slain by a Virginia Tech student have been sealed by a judge as the investigation continues","publisher":"ABC News"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gdlbIdPxzuxDtE7RRLcukw--/aD01OTc7dz05NTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/4adScylA8eXEX17zGZe0aQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztmaT1maWxsO2g9NTk3O2lsPXBsYW5lO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT03NTt3PTk2MA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/96372fe5ce7737058f0f6a706700d0bf.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"959","height":"597"}},{"followId":"bf8ad268-6d17-11e5-8514-fa163e2c24a6","name":"Benghazi investigation","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"unknown","is_eligible":"false","id":"f38f8b60-c05a-3f92-bd8a-76f1a68e1416","cluster_id":"bf8ad268-6d17-11e5-8514-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"false","title":"Gowdy promises Benghazi panel report 'as soon as possible'","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/02/18/republican-promises-benghazi-panel-report-as-soon-as-possible/","image_assets":[{"width":"0","height":"0","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x8vB._8nLDUk2iPX__qkGw--/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1930609103.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H0g4oKXgFMb.szjqL4ipDw--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1930609103.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"}],"published":"2016-02-18T11:45:00Z","summary":"The leader of the House Select Committee on Benghazi promised to release a report âas soon as possibleâ as the panel approaches its two-year mark.

It moves to Nevada in just three days, and then to a slate of a dozen states on March 1, 10 days from now. Of those March 1 states, seven are in the South or Midwest, and are likely to tilt strongly toward Trump.</p>","<p>Trump, with 33 percent in South Carolina, cleared the 30 percent bar that many had pegged as a barometer for showing whether or not he had lost momentum over the last few days. Rubio and Cruz were locked in a dead heat for second place, at 22 percent each, before Rubio was projected as <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/latest-rubio-2nd-south-carolinas-gop-primary-053258453--election.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">the second-place winner </a>by less than two-tenths of one percentage point after midnight.</p>","<p>Trump won a majority of votes from veterans in this state, which has a strong military presence, despite the fact that he had explicitly blamed former President George W. Bush for the 9/11 attacks in a debate one week ago. Trump argued in that debate that the Bush administration âliedâ about whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.</p>","<p><i><b><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/live-blog-south-carolina-gop-primary-and-nevada-211903661.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Live blog: Recap Saturdayâs coverage as it happened</a></b></i></p>","<p>The South Carolina primary has been won by the eventual Republican nominee in every presidential primary since 1980, with the exception of the last one, in 2012, when former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia was the victor. And Trumpâs method of winning the Palmetto State this week defied logic or historical comparison. âTrump won this week despite coming out for [a] health care mandate, defending planned parenthood, blaming Bush for 9/11, standing by impeachment,â <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/701208529642717187\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">wrote</a> NBCâs Chuck Todd on Twitter.</p>","<p>The big question for Trump is whether he can rise above 35 percent, his total support in New Hampshire, in any state.

But Rubio may no longer have a choice whether to take on Trump directly. Trump signaled Saturday that he may soon put the Florida senator in his sights, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/701089616825159680\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">tweeting</a> that Rubio is âvery weak on illegal immigration.â</p>","<p>In exit polls, Trump won big with voters who said they prefer a candidate who âtells it like it is.â Cruz won support from voters who look for a candidate who âshares my values.â Rubio won among voters who look for someone who âcan win in November.â</p>","<p>At the Trump rally, aides backstage devoured public exit polls with glee, noting Trumpâs wins in demographic categories where his strength had been underestimated, including evangelicals and hard-core conservatives in upstate South Carolina. The aides said they believe it signals momentum for Trump heading into the March 1 states, where they once viewed Cruz as their biggest threat but now see him as increasingly neutralized.</p>","<p>âIf Cruz canât win South Carolina, where can he win?â a Trump aide, who declined to be named, told Yahoo News.</p>","<p>But even as Trump aides were making a victory lap, there were subtle shifts in strategy in South Carolina that will continue into future contests. In the final days of the primary, Trump added events at smaller venues, and he began making more unannounced stops â including swings through small-town diners. On Friday, the candidate campaigned from early morning until nearly 10 p.m. at night â not unusual for most candidates, but unusual for Trump, who typically flies home to New York every night.</p>","<p>For Cruz, the results were a disappointment. He had owned second place in polls in the state until very recently, and hoped after winning Iowa to do well in New Hampshire â where he came in third â and then to prevail again in the heavily evangelical South Carolina. But Trump won evangelical voters here 32 percent to 27 percent for Cruz.</p>","<figure width=\"5184\" height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/rvxMA7fiDPnnmSx_3L2Y9Q--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/b591e0cbc375a7c9b2776b1d67c5c26d/tumblr_inline_o2vr1wJm691t2npxi_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"426.6666666666667\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, with his wife, Heidi, addresses supporters at his primary night rally at the South Carolina State Fairgrounds in Columbia, S.C., on Saturday.

But he must fight to keep the Republican electorate from concluding that the race should be narrowed to Rubio vs. Trump. Cruz will be helped by the fact that many conservative Christian voters in the March 1 primary states across the South will remain attracted to him. But he will have to fend off Rubioâs courtship of the slice of that voting bloc who will never vote for Trump.<br /></p>","<p>Cruz, speaking last of all the candidates on Saturday night, argued that he is the only conservative remaining in the race, and that he is also the best hope for Republicans to defeat Trump.</p>","<p>âOnly one strong conservative is in a position to win this race,â Cruz said. âWe are the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump.â</p>","<p>Looking ahead to March 1, Cruzâs campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said his operation has âbeen built for this day for the entire time.â Roe said the so-called SEC primary is âan electoral map that favors us.â</p>","<p>âAnd then, after that, weâre going to go and battle out in the winner-take-all states and decide who the nominee is. So, every piece of what weâve been talking about has come together,â Roe said.</p>","<p>Rubioâs campaign breathed a sigh of relief, given the candidateâs situation just a week ago, when the Florida senator appeared to be on the ropes after his disastrous debate performance on Feb. 6 in New Hampshire. The argument undergirding the candidacies of governors Bush, Kasich and New Jerseyâs Chris Christie â that a governor with executive experience was better prepared to be president than a senator â received a fresh hearing that week.</p>","<p>But a steady debate performance this past Saturday, an endorsement from South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and strong campaigning helped Rubio recover and survive. He had once hoped for a win in this state, just as Cruz had, and would have been well-positioned here had he not stumbled in New Hampshire. Now he must gird himself for a long and brutal primary if he wants to win.</p>","<p>In an impressive election-night speech inside an industrial warehouse â just a few hundred yards from the Cruz event â Rubio acknowledged that he had arrived in South Carolina 10 days ago âin search of a new beginning and a fresh start.â</p>","<p>âMany thought it was over,â Rubio said. âSouth Carolina will always be the place of new beginnings and fresh starts.â</p>","<figure width=\"5184\" height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/B4QGtllNtrL6XsVMpJUW8w--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/567241770e8c4d25ee0c7485828ac0c7/tumblr_inline_o2vr66rdet1t2npxi_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"426.6666666666667\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Former Florida Gov.

After over-performing in New Hampshire, Bush got a two-point bump right away. But his performance there came at an enormous cost, with <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/briefs/campaigns-brief-how-to-watch-new-hampshire/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">data showing</a> that his campaign and his super-PAC spent a total of $36 million in New Hampshire, as compared to just $3.7 million for Trump and only $580,000 for Cruz.</p>","<p>Then came the debate bloodbath on Feb. 13, a debate in which Cruz and Rubio ripped into one another and Bush tried to take on Trump, with some success. Trump looked intemperate and out of control and was booed repeatedly.</p>","<p>âI believe Jeb Bush has emerged as the alternative to Donald Trump,â Â <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/another-cruz-and-rubio-flame-war-benefits-bush-050042637.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said </a>on CBS News after the debate.</p>","<p>On Sunday and into Monday, there was the possibility that Jeb might be mounting a comeback, especially when it was announced that his older brother, George W. Bush, would come Monday to campaign for him.</p>","<p>The former president ridiculed and criticized Trump, but did not name him. George W. Bush described his brother as âa man of deep and humble faith that reveals itself through good works, not loud words.â</p>","<p>âStrength is not empty rhetoric, it is not bluster, it is not theatrics,â Bush said. âReal strength comes from integrity and character.â</p>","<p>But none of it made any difference.</p>","<p>Trump held an hourlong press conference Monday afternoon to draw attention away from the former presidentâs campaign stop, and assiduously avoided any direct and open confrontation with George W. Bush. With Trump avoiding escalation and focusing his rhetoric on Cruz, there was no real reason for W. to respond without risking more political capital than he was willing to. Bush advisers said the former president might very well have campaigned again if Trump had gone after him. Instead, Trump hid, and George W. Bush did not appear again.</p>","<p>Then, on Wednesday, press reports leaked in the morning that Haley would endorse Rubio. It was a gut punch for Bush, who, just the day before, had called winning her support âthe most meaningful endorsementâ in the state.</p>","<figure width=\"3000\" height=\"1960\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/PLJrek7p37.o3ENRGt.tEA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/17f946a96f1416530e8b4f0b06377d52/tumblr_inline_o2vrerXYcw1t2npxi_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"418.1333333333333\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i><i>GOP presidential candidate Sen.

Tim Scott and 51-year old Rep. Trey Gowdy, offering the GOP a picture of what their national profile might look like if Rubio won the nomination and picked Haley as his running mate.</p>","<p>In his concession speech, Bush choked back tears as he spoke and thanked his family. âIâm proud of the campaign that weâve run to unify our country,â he said, âbut the people of Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken, and I really respect their decision.â</p>","<p>âI congratulate my competitors who are remaining on the island,â Bush said with a slight chuckle.</p>","<p>South Carolina had been kind to the Bush family in the past.

The higher 2013 numbers are the inverse of a fall in piracy elsewhere, particularly in the seas off Somalia. There, hijacking and theft reached a peak in 2011-12, becoming so severe that the industry was forced to massively ramp up its counter measuresâincluding international warship patrols and the <a href=\"http://qz.com/593272/the-capture-of-a-floating-armory-and-its-crew-reveals-a-strange-industry-on-the-high-seas/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">employment of armed guards</a>.</p>","<p>As the problem of piracy was being tackled in East Africa, it then moved to the west of the continentâperpetrated by different pirates.

His high school was in one of the country's worst school districts with a 40% dropout rate, he says.</p> <p>But that didn't deter Patel from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/how-shaan-patel-founded-a-business-that-makes-millions-2015-6\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">achieving academic excellence</a>. He was his class's valedictorian, homecoming king, andÂ <span>a White House PresidentialÂ Scholar, a program reserved for only two students per state.</span></p> <p><span>Despite getting a mere 1,760 on his first SAT practice exam, Patel spent hours studying the test, and was evenÂ able to get a perfect 2,400 score.</span></p> <p><span>With that kind of a background, Patel seemed like a perfect shoo-in for some of the top schools. But he was rejected by every Ivy League school he applied to, including Harvard, Princeton, and Brown. Stanford rejected him too.</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, Patel took a full scholarship offer from USC, enrolling in its dual BA/MD program. HeÂ always wanted to be a doctor, so it was a perfect program to prep him for medical school â butÂ he soon had a change of heart.</span></p> <h2>Part-time entrepreneur</h2> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span class=\"KonaFilter image-container display-table float_right\"><span><span class=\"image on-image\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/RUqzzf21ri1WLCOe7rHiqw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/This_perfect_SAT_scorer_got-1acd3fc55ff51a5008bab144ea4b974f\" class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" alt=\"Shaan Patel\" data-mce-source=\"Shaan Patel\" data-mce-caption=\"Patel always wanted to be a doctor.\" width=\"640\" height=\"895.0153846153846\" /></span><span class=\"source\">(Shaan Patel) <br /></span><span class=\"caption\">Patel always wanted to be a doctor. <br /> <br /></span></span></span></span>In the summer before starting med school, Patel tried to write an SAT prep book, based on his own test-taking skills. But over 100 publishers rejected his idea, so he launchedÂ <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://2400expert.com/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">an online SAT-prep site called 2400 Expert</a>Â instead, using some of his scholarship money as seed capital.</span> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Soon, his company took off, andÂ <span>McGraw-Hill, one of the publishers that initially rejected him, came back and offered him a book deal. Patel wanted to keep growing his business, so heÂ ended up taking a two-year leave of absence from USC to pursue an MBA at Yale.</span></span></p> <p>In fact, hisÂ story was so good that he was able toÂ grab the \"Shark Tank\" producers' attention, and in June 2015, he ended up goingÂ onÂ the show. (His episode didn't air until January 2016.)</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But the sharks weren't too impressed. Although they liked his growth and margins, they didn't like the fact that he was doubling as a student and entrepreneur.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"You have to be completely committed,\" Kevin O'Leary, one of the sharks, better known as \"Mr. Wonderful,\" told him. \"</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I donât believe you. You canât be a part-time entrepreneur.\"</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One by one, each shark started to drop out. Patel, who was confident he'd get multiple offers before going on the show, started to get nervous.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"That was a really scary moment â reality sort of slapped me in the face,\" Patel says.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At the end, he was able to get a deal with Mark Cuban, but at a much lower valuation. Patel sought $250,000 for a 10% stake, valuing his company at $2.5 million. He had to settle for $250,000 for 20%, slashing his company's value in half.</span></p> <h2>Most transformative experience</h2> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Still, Patel calls his experience on \"Shark Tank\" the most transformative thing to have ever happened to him. Aside from the expertise he gets from Cuban, Patel says the national exposure he received is invaluable.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Now Patel manages more than 40 employees, mostly part-time instructors. His business has a growing archive of recorded sessions and offersÂ in-person classes in nearly 20 cities nationwide.Â </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">He says his sales are projectedÂ to hit over $3 million this year, a huge jump from the $500,000 it was seeing before going on \"Shark Tank.\" He also expects to sell roughly 10,000 of his SAT-prep books in this year alone, the same amount he sold over the past four years combined.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"I'd say 'Shark Tank' was probably the single greatest moment of my life so far,\" Patel said.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It's why Patel says everyoneÂ with an idea or an actual business should apply for \"Shark Tank\" and take their chances on going on the show. And to anyone considering going on the open-call audition, Patel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://2400expert.com/how-to-get-on-shark-tank/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">offers the following three tips</a>:</span></p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong>Give away something memorable:Â </strong>You only get 60 seconds to impress the open-call directors, so make sure you impress them with something physical or memorable, preferably at the end of the open-call pitch.</p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong>Be entertaining on video:</strong> Once you pass through the next round, you're asked to submit a five- to 10-minute video. Be witty and entertaining, like Patel did. (\"I'm an Indian-American who got a perfect score on the SAT, got straight A's, my parents own both a gas station and motel â yes \"Patel Motel\" is a thing â and I'm in med school to become a doctor. So I'm pretty much every Indian stereotype rolled into one.\")</p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong>Fill out the application as if you're talking to a stranger:</strong> The application is over 20 pages long, but the producers know nothing about your business.

After that's all cooked, assemble the sandwiches with English muffins and sliced cheese. Freeze in plastic bags and microwave for about a minute and a half before heading out the door.

Her lawyers say she was too frightened of him for years to disclose what happened.</p>","<p>Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Gottwald, has produced hits by artists including Katy Perry, Rihanna, Pitbull and Miley Cyrus.</p>","<p>Kesha Rose Sebert was an 18-year-old unknown from Nashville when she signed a contract with one of his companies in 2005, according to court papers.</p>","<p>Five years later, \"Tik Tok\" was the No. 1 song in the country. She's released two albums, most recently in 2012.</p>","<p>Kesha continues to play some shows, but her lawyers say the contract has essentially stalled her career because she can't stand working with her accused rapist.</p>","<p>Lawyers for Dr. Luke and Sony Music Entertainment â his partner in Kesha's record label, Kemosabe Records â say she's violating the five-album agreement by not recording. They say she doesn't have to work with him personally, though he has rights to produce at least six songs on each of her albums and could pursue damages if he doesn't.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Kesha's lawyer, Mark Geragos, asked a judge Friday to bar enforcement of the contract while the case plays out.
