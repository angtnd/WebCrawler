(Photo: John Locher/AP)</i></p>","<p>A week before Nevadaâs Democratic caucus, Hillary Clinton abruptly cancelled a rally in Palm Beach, sending her husband in her place. Instead, the former secretary of state appeared at three small campaign events in Reno, and then, on Sunday, showed up for service at Victory Missionary Baptist Church in Las Vegas, with her friend and civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis of Georgia in tow.<br /></p>","<p>âCrashingâ would be a strong word to describe Clintonâs presence at the African American church, but Bernie Sanders had planned a campaign stop there <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-02-14/clinton-sanders-speak-at-las-vegas-church\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">before the secretary of state had</a>. Now, the senator was upstaged at his own event.</p>","<p>Lewis introduced her as his âbeloved sisterâ and a âwarrior.â Then, Clinton obliquely criticized Sanders, as he listened from a nearby pew. âI am not a single issue candidate and this is not a single issue country,â Clinton said.</p>","<p>The former secretary of state has been in an all-out sprint in this final week before Saturdayâs caucus, attempting to defend a state that she has long called her firewall. Sanders built surprising momentum in Nevada, a diverse state that, should he win it, would go a long way to silence critics who say the democratic socialist can only win with white voters and lacks the broad appeal to be the nominee. Clinton, whose campaign manager Robby Mook earned his stripes in 2008 working Nevada for her, has had a strong operation here since April, and until recently had a commanding double digit lead in the stateâs notoriously unreliable polls. </p>","\n<!-- more -->","<p>But Sanders came from behind: outspending Clinton two to one on television ads and quickly building up a campaign operation to rival hers in size. His win in New Hampshire and near-win in Iowa catapulted him from unrealistic longshot to serious contender. The latest Nevada poll showed the rivals in a statistical tie. In his final rally before the caucus, Sanders told the thousands of supporters who showed up that he had a âfeelingâ they would âmake historyâ on Saturday.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Clinton did not sound as confident as the senator in her final rally, which drew a few hundred supporters in Las Vegas Friday night. âWeâve got to be in this together,â she said, urging them to bring as many people as possible to caucus for her Saturday morning. âI want you tell them this, If they will stand with me tomorrow, I will stand and fight for them.â</p>","<p>A Clinton staffer who did not want to be named talking about strategy said that the campaign realized many Clinton supporters did not fully understand Nevadaâs caucus process, which is only eight years old. Having Clinton herself appear at events and explain the importance of the caucus was the best way to motivate voters to actually show up. âHaving the candidate is always better,â the staffer said. </p>","<p>Clintonâs decision to stay in Nevada an extra day also led to meaningful one-on-one interactions with voters. On Sunday after the church visit, she met with young immigrants and their families, leading to a touching moment that the campaign <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/clinton-appeals-to-nevada-latinos-in-emotional-ad-154252373.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">in which Clinton comforted a 10-year-old girl whose parents might get deported</a>. The Clinton campaign later turned the moment into an ad. </p>","<p>Clinton campaigned in Nevada four of the past six days at a grueling pace, while Sanders stumped in the state for just three of those days, spending the rest of his time in Detroit and South Carolina. Clintonâs high-profile surrogates were also out in full force before Sandersâ were. Cabinet members Ken Salazar and Tom Perez, several members of Congress, actresses Chloe Grace Moretz, Eva Longoria and Jamie Lee Curtis, and labor activists Dolores Huerta all appeared at multiple, daily events for the former secretary of state in the past week. Sandersâ surrogates, including Dick Van Dyke and Susan Sarandon, appeared in the final days before the caucus.</p>","<p>Clinton also held at least four back-of-the-house meetings with casino workers in the past week, hoping for a repeat of 2008 when she handily won the casino caucus sites. </p>","<p>Some see Clintonâs frenzied pace as a sign of desperation as she contemplates losing a state that was once a given. âI think her campaign has been more manic and frenetic,â said Jon Ralston, a long-time political reporter in Nevada who writes a column for the Reno Gazette-Journal. </p>","<p>But if the desperation works, and Clinton carries the day, Sandersâ team may wonder if they should not have kept the candidate in the state for an extra day or two. After all, if Sanders could win in Nevada, he could make the pitch that he can appeal to a diverse electorate, and Clinton would be in a significantly weaker position going into South Carolina and Super Tuesday. </p>","<p>But the Sanders momentum may push him to victory on Saturday anyway. </p>","<p>âHis campaign [in Nevada] is just not what hers is here and never has been,â Ralston said. âBut it might not need to be.â</p>"]},"property":"politics","images":[{"caption":"Hillary Clintonâs week-long sprint to save Nevada","id":"9ba5ed1e-a794-3de1-bc16-88e489f3085e","title":"Hillary Clintonâs week-long sprint to save Nevada","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Hillary Clintonâs week-long sprint to save Nevada","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/24xX2sEJ7xR7SrHGfTLHbw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/708f28300def58d0cab27af0aa807503","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"U.S. Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaign in Las Vegas ahead of the state&#39;s key nominating contest.

That'd be fine too, if you just call me by my name.\"</p>","<p>There's the last name too, which is pronounced like a synonym for a beer.</p>","<p>\"Yeah,\" Abreu said with a laugh. \"A-Brew.\"</p>","<p>No wonder he's popular around the track. He faced a lengthy line at a fan autograph session here Friday afternoon and drove to huge cheers in that night's 250-mile season-opening race here at Daytona International Speedway.</p>","<p>Abreu started 16th, ran in the middle of the pack for most of the night before getting caught in a wreck and finishing 29th.</p>","<p>Still, he's just getting started. He is infectious. He is funny. He is open. He, at age 24, is just so happy to be here, running around an infield near all the major Sprint Cup stars rather than winning on dirt tracks somewhere.</p>","<p>Not that he doesn't still love dirt tracks. When he won his second consecutive Chili Bowl National in Oklahoma he unleashed an epic burnout that went viral among race fans. He delivered 14 full spins, many of them with the front wheels of his car off the ground, to a roaring crowd that was soon chanting his name, \"Ri-CO, Ri-CO.\"</p>","<span class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n <div style=\"left:0px;\" id=\"ymh-player-swf\" class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\">\n  <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVcSCJZM8tU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n </div></span>"],"remaining_body":["<p>He then climbed the fence for good measure.</p>","<p>\"I like to show my emotions after winning because I know how emotional fans get, how passionate fans can get,\" Abreu said. \"Sometimes we need to give back.</p>","<p>\"I never really was good at [burnouts],\" he said. \"Every time I won I tried to do donuts here or there, but I never did them that good.

He's Rico.</p>","<p>\"My unique stature, I've never let anything like that bother me,\" he said.</p>","<p>Abreu was born with Achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that limits bone growth. However, growing up in tiny Rutherford, Calif., in the state's famed wine country, he was treated like every other kid, especially by his parents. He played sports until they didn't make sense. He wrestled in high school. He never asked for special treatment.</p>","<p>Mostly he never let anyone else define anything about him or set limits for him. He told the Associated Press that he was fine with coming to the conclusion that not everything was for him, but if someone else made that determination, he'd prove them wrong.</p>","<p>What he eventually found was a passion, and a talent, for racing, first motorbikes, then karts and now all the way to trucks, taking a season-long deal to operate the ThorSport Racing No. 98 Toyota.</p>","<p>NASCAR allowed the cab to be refitted to have a custom-made seat and the pedals and steering wheel set-up to fit his stature. As such, he feels he is on equal footing on the track.</p>","<p>\"No disadvantage at all because of how comfortable I am in our cars and obviously NASCAR is allowing us to do all of these adjustments for me to fit in the car,\" Abreu said.</p>","<p>If anything, he says his smaller size means he weighs less than other drivers, making the truck slightly lighter. So maybe that's an actual advantage. He said he's willing to have some weight put on the truck if necessary, just to make it fair.</p>","<p>(Even that's not really an advantage, as NASCAR mandates a minimum weight for all trucks.)</p>","<p>\"That's about the only thing they can use against me,\" he said with a laugh.</p>","<p>Abreu doesn't care. He feels good about his chances. He acknowledges he's inexperienced in trucks and stock cars and is still young and has a ton to learn, but that's the fun part. He really just wants to have a good time and see what happens.</p>","<p>It's what got him this far. He understands why his size turns heads, but this is racing, it's all about finishing first and nothing else.</p>","<p>\"I've just gone out and raced,\" Abreu said. \"I've been surrounded by a lot of good people. They've all put me in the right places at the right time; it's worked out. Everything is put in place and they just leave it up to me to go out and win.\"</p>","<p>Fans love him, are inspired by him, are charmed by him and can't help but cheer for him. Even the biggest-name drivers are learning to enjoy the new guy â Dale Earnhardt Jr. couldn't stop raving about him after Rico crashed a press session the other day to take a selfie with the NASCAR legend.</p>","<p>Out of wine country, of all places, comes this guy, of all people, to give the entire sport a blast of energy. It seems unlikely, until you see him drive and smile and celebrate.</p>","<p>Then it all makes perfect sense.</p>","<p><strong>More Daytona 500 coverage on Yahoo Sports:</strong></p>","<span class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n <div style=\"left:0px;\" id=\"ymh-player-swf\" class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\">\n  <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><div class=\"js-video-placeholder RatioBox Bgc-x Bd-0\" data-yepConfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;page_space_id&quot;:&quot;2146310113&quot;,&quot;video_uuid&quot;:&quot;e8661be9-c6c4-3b7a-8fed-d7fcbf601c4c&quot;,&quot;device&quot;:&quot;desktop&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;sports&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{&quot;showTitle&quot;:true,&quot;showDescription&quot;:true,&quot;showButton&quot;:true,&quot;showProvider&quot;:false},&quot;width&quot;:640}\"></div></div>\n </div></span>","<p>Â </p>"]},"property":"sports","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"a4e0a6a8-0586-3040-badc-2d4eed14bc1c","licensed":"true","title":"Nobody has any idea whatâs going to happen in the Nevada caucuses.

The first is fairly straightforward: by winning the most votes. That is how Donald Trump, for example, triumphed last week in New Hampshire. <br /><br /> The second way is less, shall we say, scientific. If the media expects you to perform at a certain level, and then, on primary or caucus day, you perform better, you are said to have won the so-called expectations game. <br /><br /> Itâs hard to pinpoint where these âexpectationsâ come from or how, exactly, they form, but the biggest factor, by far, is public opinion polling. Thatâs why Marco Rubio was considered one of the winners of the Iowa caucuses earlier this month: He was polling at about 17 percent before caucusing began but wound up nearly stealing second place from Trump with 23 percent of the vote. <br /><br /> What happens, however, when there is no reliable polling to go on? How is the media supposed to figure out who â other than the numerical winner, of course â has emerged victorious on primary or caucus night? </p>","<p> Weâre about to find out. In Nevada â where the Democratic caucuses take place on Saturday and the Republican caucuses follow next Tuesday â no one has any idea what to expect. So far, only two Republican and three Democratic polls of Nevada voters have been released since the start of 2016, and observers arenât putting a whole lot of stock in them. </p>","<p> Why? Because itâs very, very challenging â if not impossible â to produce a reliable caucus poll here. </p>","<p> âItâs a total mystery whatâs going to happen,â Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, a Rubio supporter, told Yahoo News. âThe people who do this for a living are saying, âWho knows?ââ <br /><br /> Another case in point: 2008. In that yearâs <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/nv/nevada_republican_caucus-235.html#polls\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">final Republican polling average</a>, Mitt Romney led John McCain 25.7 percent to 20.7 percent; Ron Paul was polling at 7.3. But in the actual caucuses, Romney won 51.1 percent of the vote, McCain got 12.7 percent and Paul got 13.7 percent. The polling was way, way off. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> The same thing happened on the Democratic side. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/nv/nevada_democratic_caucus-236.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">the final average</a>, Hillary Clinton was four percentage points ahead of Barack Obama: 37.8 percent to 33.8 percent. John Edwards trailed with 18 percent. The actual caucus results, however, were wildly different: 50.7 percent for Clinton, 45.2 percent for Obama, 3.8 percent for Edwards.</p>","<p> To be fair, caucuses are always harder to poll than primaries; fewer people participate because the process tends to be more convoluted and time-consuming. But there are several reasons why the Nevada caucuses are particularly difficult to get a good read on. <br /><br /> A poll is only as good as the mix of voters it represents. The closer a pollster comes to nailing the demographic makeup of the electorate â women, young people, Latinos and so on â the more accurate his or her horserace numbers are likely to be. </p>","<p> In Nevada, that mix is hard to get right. </p>","<p> For one thing, the Nevada caucuses are a fairly new phenomenon. They were first held in 2008. Thatâs not a lot of history to go on. Iowans have been caucusing for generations; Nevadans, not so much. When youâre trying to identify likely caucus-goers, the first people you look for are people who have caucused before. In Nevada, there arenât many of them. The total GOP turnout in 2012? Just 33,000 people. </p>","<p> Nevadans are also highly transient. Theyâre constantly coming and going. Needless to say, that makes it difficult to interview them; it also makes it difficult to figure out how likely they are to participate in the caucuses, because they havenât necessarily lived in the state long enough to establish any real voting patterns. </p>","<p> Then there are the odd hours Nevadans work, especially in the major population centers like Las Vegas and Reno. Casinos are open all night. So are many restaurants. Pollsters who call during the day will miss the nine-to-five workers; pollsters who call later will miss the folks on the night shift. Itâs too expensive for most pollsters to conduct polls both day and night. </p>","<p> Finally, Nevadaâs fast-growing minority population is a factor as well. Itâs mostly Latino. It skews younger. And younger Latinos tend to use cellphones, which makes them â you guessed it â harder (and more expensive) to reach. As a result, the people who respond to Democratic surveys may be older and whiter than the people who actually show up on caucus day. </p>","<p> On the Democratic side, the latest polls â all three of them â show Clinton leading Sanders by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nv/nevada_democratic_presidential_caucus-5337.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">an average of 2.4 percentage points</a>; on the Republican side, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nv/nevada_republican_presidential_caucus-5336.html#polls\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> Trump is leading with 42 percent of the vote</a>, and Rubio and Ted Cruz are basically tied for second with 19 percent and 20 percent, respectively. </p>","<p> But donât expect the actual results to resemble those numbers. None of the experts here do. Whatever happens in the caucuses â both Democratic and Republican â will be something of a surprise. </p>","<p> Nevada prides itself on being âFirst in the West.â Itâs certainly going to be wild. </p>"]},"property":"politics","images":[{"caption":"Nobody has any idea whatâs going to happen in the Nevada caucuses.

Apple is embroiled in a <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-vs-fbi-where-does-everyone-stand-163132527.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">dispute with the Justice Department</a> over an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in the San Bernardino massacre of Dec. 2.

Apple CEO Tim Cook says thatâs no easy task and doing so would set a precedent allowing hackers and crooks easier access to iPhones worldwide. Apple is contesting the FBI order in court, with an <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-encryption-freespeech-idUSKCN0VS025\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">appeal</a> set for Feb. 26. But further appeals could keep the matter in court for months.</p>","<p>Trump, with his genius for publicity, is playing the law-and-order card, in calling for Apple to do what the FBI wants. âBoycott Apple until such time as they give that information,â <a href=\"https://beta.finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-calls-apple-boycott-over-203603863.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Trump said recently</a> at a rally in South Carolina. âApple should give up.â Trump, of course, also took to Twitter to affirm his position:</p>","<span class=\"yui-tweet yui-editorial-embed\">I use both iPhone & Samsung.

Rarely does one famous brand confront another so pugnaciously, so we get to see how both of them shadowbox in the limelight. In Appleâs corner: The worldâs most revered tech company, according to the <a href=\"http://www.theharrispoll.com/business/Tech-Industry-Repuation.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">latest annual rankings by Harris</a>, with a â<a href=\"http://www.theharrispoll.com/reputation-quotient\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">reputationalâ score of excellent</a>. In Trumpâs corner: a <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/donald-trump-favorable-rating\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">38% favorable rating</a> and the lead, for now, in the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> race for the Republican presidential nomination</a>.</p>","<p>Those circumstances seem to favor Apple in a toe-to-toe matchup with Trump, especially since a boycott of Apple is sort of an absurd premise. There are something like 1 billion devices in consumer pockets running on Appleâs iOS software, and most people canât live without their phone or tablet for more than a few moments. Besides, Cook says heâs sticking up for consumers by stiff-arming the feds (though not everybody believes that).</p>","<span class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\"><div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/trump-takes-apple-212410432.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div></span>","<p>But public opinion seems split on the issue of whether Apple should comply with the FBI, especially since nobody really cares about the privacy of a terrorist sympathetic to ISIS who murdered 14 civilians at an office party. The FBI also seems to be banking that public opinion will swing around to its view; it bypassed many other chances to challenge Apple on encryption on phones used by alleged criminals, apparently waiting for an ideal case. The stars may have aligned, making the San Bernardino case the strongest the FBI could have hoped for.</p>","<p>Trump has called for boycotts before. He tried to gin up a Macyâs (<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=m\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">M</a>) boycott after the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2015/11/12/donald-trump-calls-for-a-macys-boycott/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">retailer dropped his product line </a>last year. And he tried to round up conservatives last year to boycott Starbucks (<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=sbux\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">SBUX</a>) when the coffee chain wasnât sufficiently reverent toward the religious origins of Christmas. Both efforts fizzled.</p>","<p>His criticism of Apple may land harder, because itâs a much bigger issue. Hereâs my prediction: Apple is going to cave, and find a way to unlock the San Bernardino phone so the FBI can have a look. Not because Trump said they should, but because public opinion is going to shift in favor of the FBI as the case gains more notoriety and more people realize whatâs at stake. The company will also decide a long series of legal appeals are more trouble than theyâre worth, especially if thereâs a chance of losing in the end. Apple, after all, is a consumer products company, and it has edged away from hard-line policies before when consumers have edged it along.

His high school was in one of the country's worst school districts with a 40% dropout rate, he says.</p> <p>But that didn't deter Patel from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/how-shaan-patel-founded-a-business-that-makes-millions-2015-6\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">achieving academic excellence</a>. He was his class's valedictorian, homecoming king, andÂ <span>a White House PresidentialÂ Scholar, a program reserved for only two students per state.</span></p> <p><span>Despite getting a mere 1,760 on his first SAT practice exam, Patel spent hours studying the test, and was evenÂ able to get a perfect 2,400 score.</span></p> <p><span>With that kind of a background, Patel seemed like a perfect shoo-in for some of the top schools. But he was rejected by every Ivy League school he applied to, including Harvard, Princeton, and Brown. Stanford rejected him too.</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, Patel took a full scholarship offer from USC, enrolling in its dual BA/MD program. HeÂ always wanted to be a doctor, so it was a perfect program to prep him for medical school â butÂ he soon had a change of heart.</span></p> <h2>Part-time entrepreneur</h2> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span class=\"KonaFilter image-container display-table float_right\"><span><span class=\"image on-image\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/RUqzzf21ri1WLCOe7rHiqw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/This_perfect_SAT_scorer_got-1acd3fc55ff51a5008bab144ea4b974f\" class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" alt=\"Shaan Patel\" data-mce-source=\"Shaan Patel\" data-mce-caption=\"Patel always wanted to be a doctor.\" width=\"640\" height=\"895.0153846153846\" /></span><span class=\"source\">(Shaan Patel) <br /></span><span class=\"caption\">Patel always wanted to be a doctor. <br /> <br /></span></span></span></span>In the summer before starting med school, Patel tried to write an SAT prep book, based on his own test-taking skills. But over 100 publishers rejected his idea, so he launchedÂ <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://2400expert.com/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">an online SAT-prep site called 2400 Expert</a>Â instead, using some of his scholarship money as seed capital.</span> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Soon, his company took off, andÂ <span>McGraw-Hill, one of the publishers that initially rejected him, came back and offered him a book deal. Patel wanted to keep growing his business, so heÂ ended up taking a two-year leave of absence from USC to pursue an MBA at Yale.</span></span></p> <p>In fact, hisÂ story was so good that he was able toÂ grab the \"Shark Tank\" producers' attention, and in June 2015, he ended up goingÂ onÂ the show. (His episode didn't air until January 2016.)</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But the sharks weren't too impressed. Although they liked his growth and margins, they didn't like the fact that he was doubling as a student and entrepreneur.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"You have to be completely committed,\" Kevin O'Leary, one of the sharks, better known as \"Mr. Wonderful,\" told him. \"</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I donât believe you. You canât be a part-time entrepreneur.\"</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One by one, each shark started to drop out. Patel, who was confident he'd get multiple offers before going on the show, started to get nervous.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"That was a really scary moment â reality sort of slapped me in the face,\" Patel says.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At the end, he was able to get a deal with Mark Cuban, but at a much lower valuation. Patel sought $250,000 for a 10% stake, valuing his company at $2.5 million. He had to settle for $250,000 for 20%, slashing his company's value in half.</span></p> <h2>Most transformative experience</h2> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Still, Patel calls his experience on \"Shark Tank\" the most transformative thing to have ever happened to him. Aside from the expertise he gets from Cuban, Patel says the national exposure he received is invaluable.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Now Patel manages more than 40 employees, mostly part-time instructors. His business has a growing archive of recorded sessions and offersÂ in-person classes in nearly 20 cities nationwide.Â </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">He says his sales are projectedÂ to hit over $3 million this year, a huge jump from the $500,000 it was seeing before going on \"Shark Tank.\" He also expects to sell roughly 10,000 of his SAT-prep books in this year alone, the same amount he sold over the past four years combined.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\"I'd say 'Shark Tank' was probably the single greatest moment of my life so far,\" Patel said.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It's why Patel says everyoneÂ with an idea or an actual business should apply for \"Shark Tank\" and take their chances on going on the show. And to anyone considering going on the open-call audition, Patel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://2400expert.com/how-to-get-on-shark-tank/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">offers the following three tips</a>:</span></p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong>Give away something memorable:Â </strong>You only get 60 seconds to impress the open-call directors, so make sure you impress them with something physical or memorable, preferably at the end of the open-call pitch.</p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong>Be entertaining on video:</strong> Once you pass through the next round, you're asked to submit a five- to 10-minute video. Be witty and entertaining, like Patel did. (\"I'm an Indian-American who got a perfect score on the SAT, got straight A's, my parents own both a gas station and motel â yes \"Patel Motel\" is a thing â and I'm in med school to become a doctor. So I'm pretty much every Indian stereotype rolled into one.\")</p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong>Fill out the application as if you're talking to a stranger:</strong> The application is over 20 pages long, but the producers know nothing about your business. The only way to keep them interested is to ask yourself, \"What would a stranger want to know next?\" until you've conveyed all your thoughts.</p> <p>You can watch Patel's appearance on \"Shark Tank\" below:</p> <p>\n    <div> \n     <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YelQqrKT3r8\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div> \n    </div> <p>NOW WATCH: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/shark-tank-barbara-corcoran-manterruptions-mark-cuban-entrepreneurs-2016-1\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">How Barbara Corcoran uses 'manterruptions' to beat the other sharks</a></p><br /><br /><b>More From Business Insider </b><br />\n    <ul>\n     <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-buys-predictionio-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Salesforce just bought another startup in the machine learning space</a><br /></li>\n     <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/theres-an-anonymous-group-of-amazon-employees-to-complain-about-the-company-and-they-want-to-unionize-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">There's a website just for upset Amazon employees to post reviews, and its organizers want a union</a><br /></li>\n     <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoos-plan-to-combine-its-sales-team-with-tumblr-failed-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Yahoo is ditching a plan that caused turmoil within Tumblr</a><br /></li>\n    </ul></p> </p></p></p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"474b4a28-8910-3523-b4b7-f6153bde5266","licensed":"true","title":"This Castle on Lake Tahoe Is the Waterfront Chateau of Your Dreams","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/castle-lake-tahoe-waterfront-chateau-193626267.html","summary":"There&#39;s a hugeÂ wine cellar, mountain views, cozyÂ fireplaces,Â and no reason to leave.","entities":"WIKIID:Lake_Tahoe|WIKIID:Incline_Village,_Nevada","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001001039|YCT:001001049","publisher":"House Beautiful","author":"Lauren Smith","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/52KKKcueQJHOif_aeZQaew--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-01-15/c0167f50-bbb6-11e5-907f-c15c0cbce72d_47096588f58c015073297a3a8eddd689.jpg","provider_url":"http://www.housebeautiful.com/","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"7645365","propertyRegion":"YPROP:realestate","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"7645365","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Lake_Tahoe;Incline_Village,_Nevada;Sierra_Nevada_%28U.S.%29;Wine_cellar\" ctopid=\"2335000;2335500\" hashtag=\"2335000;2335500\" rs=\"lmsid:a0ad000000BfCOoAAN;revsp:house_beautiful_336;lpstaid:474b4a28-8910-3523-b4b7-f6153bde5266\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"embedded_images":[{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/e379fde99f0872b66d68527b30cc062b"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/4a5c137f60e82619df15d4cba021419b"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/118bd4c5b3274cce0cb8fbd6bd41b313"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/1563a3c67a80c904be1bd9deb0b100ec"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/1655ebac9ceeeeab636145865eba0572"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/2613975ee3e9e820413fa33e63f3b985"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/55057a39c83d776d3ba84ed56655ffd2"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/24a2fdfcbdf0409c1ced91a88884e311"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/b260e7139d1becca70341391f2a22c21"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/5b6478835b0c2e96983d1a4067a74a15"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/8a6d7442c2118d426cd2380de397e2d1"},{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/house_beautiful_336/8f910b9491485762c7eb8322e89cad21"}],"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"Thu, Feb 18 11:36 AM PST","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo -
