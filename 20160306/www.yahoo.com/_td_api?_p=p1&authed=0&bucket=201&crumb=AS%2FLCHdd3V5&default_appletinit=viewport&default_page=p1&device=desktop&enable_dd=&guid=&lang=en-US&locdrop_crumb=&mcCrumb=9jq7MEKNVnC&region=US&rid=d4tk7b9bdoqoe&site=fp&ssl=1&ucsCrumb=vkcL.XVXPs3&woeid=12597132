She was 94.</p>","<p>The former first lady died Sunday at her home in Bel-Air, California, of congestive heart failure, assistant Allison Borio told The Associated Press.</p>","<p>Her best-known project as first lady was the \"Just Say No\" campaign to help kids and teens stay off drugs.</p>","<p>When she swept into the White House in 1981, the former Hollywood actress partial to designer gowns and pricey china was widely dismissed as a pre-feminist throwback, concerned only with fashion, decorating and entertaining. By the time she moved out eight years later, Mrs. Reagan was fending off accusations that she was a behind-the-scenes \"dragon lady\" wielding unchecked power over the Reagan administration â and doing it based on astrology to boot.</p>","<p>All along she maintained that her only mission was to back her \"Ronnie\" and strengthen his presidency.</p>","<p>Mrs. Reagan carried that charge through the rest of her days. She served as a full-time caretaker as Alzheimer's melted away her husband's memory. After his death in June 2004 she dedicated herself to tending his legacy, especially at his presidential library in California, where he had served as governor.</p>","<p>She also championed Alzheimer's patients, raising millions of dollars for research and breaking with fellow conservative Republicans to advocate for stem cell studies. Her dignity and perseverance in these post-White House roles helped smooth over the public's fickle perceptions of the former first lady.</p>","<p>The Reagans' mutual devotion over 52 years of marriage was legendary. They were forever holding hands. She watched his political speeches with a look of such steady adoration it was dubbed \"the gaze.\" He called her \"Mommy,\" and penned a lifetime of gushing love notes. She saved these letters, published them as a book, and found them a comfort when he could no longer remember her.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>In announcing his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 1994, Reagan wrote, \"I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience.\" Ten years later, as his body lay in state in the U.S. Capitol, Mrs. Reagan caressed and gently kissed the flag-draped casket.</p>","<p>As the newly arrived first lady, Mrs. Reagan raised more than $800,000 from private donors to redo the White House family quarters and to buy a $200,000 set of china bordered in red, her signature color. She was criticized for financing these pet projects with donations from millionaires who might seek influence with the government, and for accepting gifts and loans of dresses worth thousands of dollars from top designers. Her lavish lifestyle â in the midst of a recession and with her husband's administration cutting spending on the needy â inspired the mocking moniker \"Queen Nancy.\"</p>","<p>But her admirers credited Mrs. Reagan with restoring grace and elegance to the White House after the austerity of the Carter years.</p>","<p>Her substantial influence within the White House came to light slowly in her husband's second term.</p>","<p><a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/photos/nancy-reagan-a-look-back-slideshow/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"><em><strong>SLIDESHOW â Nancy Reagan: A look back >>></strong></em></a></p>","<p><span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1457285874621\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"></span><a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/photos/nancy-reagan-a-look-back-slideshow/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Left\"><img title=\"CLICK IMAGE for slideshow: Former first lady Nancy Reagan waits to greet Republican presidential candidates in a replica of the Oval Office at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, before the Reagan Centennial GOP presidential primary debate in Simi Valley, California September 7, 2011.

She urged Reagan to finally break his long silence on the AIDS crisis. She nudged him to publicly accept responsibility for the arms-for-hostages scandal. And she worked to buttress those advisers urging him to thaw U.S. relations with the Soviet Union, over the objections of the administration's \"evil empire\" hawks.</p>","<p>Near the end of Reagan's presidency, ex-chief of staff Regan took his revenge with a memoir revealing that the first lady routinely consulted a San Francisco astrologer to guide the president's schedule. Mrs. Reagan, who had a longtime interest in horoscopes, maintained that she used the astrologer's forecasts only in hopes of predicting the safest times for her husband to venture out of the White House after an assassination attempt by John Hinckley just three months into Reagan's presidency.</p>","<p>Anne Frances Robbins, nicknamed Nancy, was born on July 6, 1921, in New York City. Her parents separated soon after she was born and her mother, film and stage actress Edith Luckett, went on the road. Nancy was reared by an aunt until 1929, when her mother married Dr. Loyal Davis, a wealthy Chicago neurosurgeon who gave Nancy his name and a socialite's home. She majored in drama at Smith College and found stage work with the help of her mother's connections.</p>","<p>In 1949, MGM signed 5-foot-4, doe-eyed brunette Nancy Davis to a movie contract. She was cast mostly as a loyal housewife and mother. She had a key role in \"The Next Voice You Hear ...,\" an unusual drama about a family that hears God's voice on the radio. In \"Donovan's Brain,\" she played the wife of a scientist possessed by disembodied gray matter.</p>","<p>She met Ronald Reagan in 1950, when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild and she was seeking help with a problem: Her name had been wrongly included on a published list of suspected communist sympathizers. They discussed it over dinner, and she later wrote that she realized on that first blind date \"he was everything that I wanted.\"</p>","<p>They wed two years later, on March 4, 1952. Daughter Patti was born in October of that year and son Ron followed in 1958. Reagan already had a daughter, Maureen, and an adopted son, Michael, from his marriage to actress Jane Wyman. (Later, public spats and breaches with her grown children would become a frequent source of embarrassment for Mrs. Reagan.)</p>","<p>She was thrust into the political life when her husband ran for California governor in 1966 and won. She found it a surprisingly rough business.</p>","<p>\"The movies were custard compared to politics,\" Mrs. Reagan said.</p>","<p>___</p>","<p>This report includes biographical material written by former AP staffers Jeff Wilson and Connie Cass.</p>"]},"property":"news","images":[{"caption":"FILE - This December 1986, file photo shows first lady Nancy Reagan holding the Reagans&#39; pet Rex, a King Charles spaniel, as she and President Reagan walk on the White House South lawn.

Peyton Manning will announce his retirement on Monday, one month to the day after winning Super Bowl 50 with the Denver Broncos.</p>","<p>ESPN's Chris Mortensen, technically on hiatus as he battles cancer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mortreport/status/706450133232152577\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">was first with the news</a> on Sunday morning. Mortensen cited a source familiar with Manning's decision. The team confirmed the news shortly after, with a statement from general manager John Elway.</p>","<blockquote> \n <p><span>âWhen you look at everything Peyton has accomplished as a player and person, itâs easy to see how fortunate weâve been to have him on our team,\" Elway said. \"Peyton was everything that we thought he was and even moreânot only for the football team but in the community.</span></p> \n</blockquote>","<blockquote> \n <p><span>âThereâs no question that his work ethic is what made him into one of the great quarterbacks of all time. All the film study Peyton did and the process that he went through with game planning and understanding what the other teams did was second-to-none.</span></p> \n</blockquote>","<blockquote> \n <p><span>âPeyton was a player that guys wanted to play with. That made us better as a team, and Iâm thrilled that we were able to win a championship in his final year. Peyton won a lot of awards and set a lot of records, but to me, what he helped our team accomplish during the last four years is what stands out the most.</span></p> \n</blockquote>","<blockquote> \n <p><span>âIâm very thankful Peyton chose to play for the Denver Broncos and I congratulate him on his Hall of Fame career.â</span></p> \n</blockquote>","<p>The official retirement will be made at the Broncos' facility; Manning signed with Denver in 2012 and was with the franchise for two Super Bowl appearances (the Broncos lost to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII).</p>","<p>Fox Sports' Mike Garafolo tweeted that Manning <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeGarafolo/status/706470845686788097\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">told the Broncos of his decision</a> on Saturday night, and called team president Joe Ellis, Elway and head coach Gary Kubiak to inform them.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Manning's announcement has been expected, as his level of play fell off significantly this past season, and he was benched for Brock Osweiler after a four-interception performance against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 9. Shortly after, news came that Manning was dealing with plantar fasciitis, and he spent the rest of the regular season healing and rehabbing.</p>","<p>Manning started the Broncos' three playoff games, but did not throw a touchdown pass in two of those contests, including the Super Bowl.</p>","<p>Manningâs retirement will be compared to how his boss, Elway, stepped away. The Broncos' general manager is the only Hall of Fame quarterback who retired immediately after a Super Bowl win. Manning will be a first-ballot Hall of Famer in 2021. Manningâs farewell to the NFL will be winning Super Bowl 50 over the Carolina Panthers, his second Super Bowl title.</p>","<p>Manningâs rÃ©sumÃ© is impressive. Heâs the NFLâs only five-time MVP. He is a seven-time first-team All-Pro. He owns the single-season and career records for passing yards and passing touchdowns. Manning is the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl as the starting quarterback of two different franchises. He had an amazing run with the Indianapolis Colts, then after missing the 2011 season with a neck injury, he signed with the Broncos and had four strong seasons with them.</p>","<p>Manningâs final few months in the NFL included a championship, but plenty of controversy too. Late last season, an Al Jazeera report said Manningâs <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/al-jazeera-ped-report-released-as-peyton-manning-considers-lawsuit-030943511.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">wife received human-growth hormone</a> through an anti-aging clinic in Indianapolis, and the report suggested Manning used HGH. Manning angrily denied the claims in that report. In February, there was a renewed focus on <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/peyton-manning-2003-testimony--i-mooned-a-friend-for-one-second-165849184.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">a 20-year-old incident </a>in which a female University of Tennessee athletic trainer claimed Manning placed his <span>\"naked butt and rectum\" and his genitals on her face, though Manning says he didnât do that and simply mooned a teammate. <br /></span></p>","<p><span>Whether the recent negative news will ultimately affect Manningâs legacy remains to be seen. But his rÃ©sumÃ© on the field is unprecedented. Manning walks away as one of the biggest legends in NFL history, and a Super Bowl champion. </span></p>","<p id=\"yui-tmp-10\" style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"Ta-c \"><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><em>- - - - - - -</em></span></p>","<p><strong><a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/author/frank-schwab/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Frank Schwab</a> </strong>is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.shutdowncorner.com\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"><strong>Shutdown Corner</strong></a> on Yahoo Sports.

PALM BEACH, Fla. â Republicans in Maine and Kansas breathed new life into Sen. Ted Cruzâs presidential campaign Saturday, handing him significant victories in GOP caucuses as he seeks to position himself as the chief alternative to frontrunner Donald Trump. </p>","<p> But Trump didnât come up completely empty in the four states that made up the so-called âSuper Saturdayâ voting. The real estate mogul claimed narrow victories over Cruz in Louisiana and Kentucky â suggesting that his race to lock up the delegates that are needed to secure the nomination had been slowed, but not derailed, by party figures determined to block his campaign. </p>","<p> In a press conference here Saturday night, Trump called on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who finished well behind Trump and Cruz in Saturdayâs contests, to leave the race. âItâs probably time,â he said, adding that he wanted to face Cruz âone-on-one.â </p>","<p> Trump aides were quick to play down Cruzâs victories, pointing out that he had poured more energy and resources into winning the caucus states than their boss. (Speaking to supporters, Trump fancifully suggested another reason for Cruzâs win in Maine: its proximity to Canada, where the Texas senator was born.) </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MSoSEf6QbHA1eNh6ubRDRg--/aD00Mjc7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/470cd15d88eabb9e322299f77ca8e1e1\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" /></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Sen. Ted Cruz greets supporters at a rally on the campus of Boise State University in Idaho on Saturday. (Photo: Joe Jaszewski/Idaho Statesman/TNS via Getty Images)</i></p>","<p>But Cruzâs strong showing on Saturday was a significant blow to Trump, who had been riding a wave of what seemed to be unstoppable momentum after Super Tuesday, when he won seven states and expanded his delegate lead over Cruz, Rubio and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. Speaking to supporters, Trump appeared tired but undeterred as he talked up his âamazingâ night and predicted he will become the GOP nominee. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> In recent days, Trump has come under increased scrutiny from his rivals, who have raised questions about his business record and temperament, and from party elders like Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who have called Trump unfit for the presidency and launched efforts to derail his insurgent campaign. </p>","<p> Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, delivered a blistering speech on Thursday trashing Trump as a âphonyâ and calling on GOP voters to deny him the nomination. Romney, who sought and received Trumpâs endorsement four years ago, has also suggested he might spend part of his personal fortune to further the so-called âNever Trumpâ cause, pushed by the partyâs establishment and super-PACs aiming to bolster his rivals, who are looking to set up a convention fight over the nomination. </p>","<p> While his campaign downplayed Saturdayâs results, Trump had added last-minute stops in Maine and Kansas. On Saturday, he canceled a scheduled speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C., to stump in Wichita, Kan., where he and Cruz nearly crossed paths at a caucus site. But Trump still came up short, raising questions as to whether the attacks on his campaign are working. </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JZ_SEAEYymHjdGZamf3hqw--/aD00NDA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/8413fa6f3babb85eab47d4d679c6527c\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"440\" /></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Donald Trump addresses a press event at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Saturday. (Photo: Joe Skipper/Reuters)</i></p>","<p> After Saturdayâs results came in, Trump called on the party to unite behind him, citing what he described as âmillionsâ of new supporters he had brought into the party. He called on members of the establishment trying to block his path to the nomination to unite behind him. </p>","<p> âAs a party, we should come together and stop this foolishness,â Trump said. </p>","<p> Saturdayâs results also dealt another serious setback to Rubio, who faces the increasingly steep challenge of selling GOP voters on the idea that he, not Cruz, should be the alternative to Trump. In Kansas, he won the endorsements of several key Republican figures, including Gov. Sam Brownback and former Sen. Bob Dole. The Florida senator had canceled trips to Louisiana and Kentucky to make a last-minute play for the state â only to finish third in all three states, receiving only minimal numbers of delegates. In Maine, he finished fourth, narrowly missing the threshold for delegates. </p>","<p> So far, Rubio has won just one state â Minnesota â and trails significantly behind Trump and Cruz in the delegate race. Still, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant, in an interview with Fox News that his campaign sent to reporters, refused to cede ground to Cruz, arguing somewhat implausibly that âthe map moving forwardâ favors his boss. </p>","<p> âTed Cruz has shown that he can win his home state and neighboring state, Oklahoma and small rural caucuses, like Iowa and Alaska, and now Kansas,â Conant said. âUnfortunately, there are only two states left that have caucuses, Utah and Hawaii. After that, it is all primaries. Marco has done well in primaries so far.â </p>","<p> On Saturday, Rubio traveled to Puerto Rico, which holds its GOP primary on Sunday. Aides believe a win there could help bolster his bid to win Floridaâs March 15 primary, where the senator is counting on turnout from Hispanics to help put him over the top.</p>","<p>Â But Florida, a winner-take-all delegate state, increasingly looks like a do-or-die contest for Rubioâs struggling campaign. Early polls suggest that Trump leads Rubio there, and the businessmanâs campaign has signaled that he will campaign heavily there in the next week and a half. At the same time, Cruz announced this week that heâs opening 10 new campaign offices across the state and will also spend significant time in Florida, in what appears to be an attempt not necessarily to win but to deal a deathblow to Rubioâs campaign.</p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vCGQt.yQqm_3E.ZQTcJmdQ--/aD00Mjc7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/00b8f6dbb511daaf9163693e22a21d60\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" /></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Sen. Marco Rubio addresses the 43rd annual Conservative Political Action Conference at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Md., on Saturday. (Photo: Jim Lo Scalso/EPA)</i></p>","<p>But before the race turns to Florida, the GOP hopefuls face four other voting states this Tuesday, including Mississippi and Michigan, where an ARG poll of likely GOP voters released Saturday found Kasich surging into a statistical tie with Trump. Other polls, however, show Trump substantially ahead. A win there could potentially give Kasich a boost heading into his home state primary, also scheduled for March 15, where a Quinnipiac poll conducted in mid-February found him narrowly trailing Trump. </p>","<p> Perhaps most significant on Saturday was Cruzâs win in Maine, a state where Republicans tend to be more moderate than other states he has won, like Kansas and Oklahoma. While there was no exit polling, the results suggest that the Texas senator, who has relied largely on backing from evangelicals and ultraconservative members of the party, might be expanding his coalition of support. </p>","<p> âWhat weâre seeing is the public coming together, libertarians coming together, men and women who love the Constitution coming together and uniting and standing as one behind this campaign,â Cruz told supporters at a rally in Idaho, where he was campaigning Saturday ahead of the stateâs primary on Tuesday. </p>","<p> Like Trump, Cruz, citing his âbreadth of support,â also pushed for Rubio to quit the race â and Kasich too. </p>","<p> âWeâll continue to amass delegates, but what needs to happen is the field needs to continue to narrow,â Cruz said, according to the New York Times. âAs long as the field remains divided, it gives Donald an advantage.â </p>","<p> Thousands of miles away, standing before rows of friends at an election night gathering inside his golf club, Trump again and again said he was ready to take on Cruz head-to-head, describing him as someone who can be easily defeated. </p>","<p> âThat would be so much fun,â Trump said of facing Cruz. âOh, do I just want to run against Ted! That would be so easy.â </p>"]},"property":"politics","author":"Holly Bailey","images":[{"caption":"Cruz gains steam against Trump, as Rubio fades inÂ âSuper Saturdayâ voting","id":"0bfd6d3e-6490-328f-9969-2657eea9c673","title":"Cruz gains steam against Trump, as Rubio fades inÂ âSuper Saturdayâ voting","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Cruz gains steam against Trump, as Rubio fades inÂ âSuper Saturdayâ voting","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/W0CEaUdK_UpZliT7cJ1ytQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/470cd15d88eabb9e322299f77ca8e1e1","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"Cruz gains steam against Trump, as Rubio fades inÂ âSuper Saturdayâ voting","id":"ded01737-b713-3ca1-91bd-2544a24d89fd","title":"Cruz gains steam against Trump, as Rubio fades inÂ âSuper Saturdayâ voting","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Cruz gains steam against Trump, as Rubio fades inÂ âSuper Saturdayâ voting","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/a3N8B6bCnuWg9McEf5Pfug--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/8413fa6f3babb85eab47d4d679c6527c","alt":null},"index":2},{"caption":"Cruz gains steam against Trump, as Rubio fades inÂ âSuper Saturdayâ voting","id":"df83b9d9-c9b4-3634-b723-748c97f34707","title":"Cruz gains steam against Trump, as Rubio fades inÂ âSuper Saturdayâ voting","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Cruz gains steam against Trump, as Rubio fades inÂ âSuper Saturdayâ voting","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/INra26WbTU2RM81yd2nH9Q--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/00b8f6dbb511daaf9163693e22a21d60","alt":null},"index":3}],"count":3},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"45d090a1-2649-372c-90a2-ffbe48c431fd","licensed":"true","title":"Netflix only has partial control over its destiny","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/-netflix-subscription-growth-infrastructure-challenge-174909079.html","summary":"Netflix has experienced red-hot growth in both its subscriptions and its stock price.

<p>One woman fears her in-laws will leave behind a financial mess</p> MA MB MC MD ME ZQ ZR ZS ZT ZU <p>Dear Moneyologist,</p> <p>I have a question regarding the debt of my in-laws after they pass away.</p> <p>My husband and I have lived away from home since age 19 (we are now in our 30s). We have put ourselves through college, forgoing a formal wedding ceremony or honeymoon to instead pay down student loans. We own our own home and have children. We do not have much extra money at the end of the month but are still financially stable. Neither of our parents have been financially supportive of us, weâve done it âon our ownâ so to speak.</p> <p>My husbandâs sister (who is my age) has lived at home her whole adult life, pays no rent and works minimum wage with no desire to go to college. Her fiancÃ© moved into my in-laws house five years ago and also pays no rent, nor does he work. My in-laws are spending thousands of dollars on their wedding not to mention fully supporting them and their lifestyle. Meanwhile, my sister in-law and her fiancÃ© are spending all of their money on frivolous, extravagant things.</p> <p>My in-laws do not have the money to do this and so are racking up huge amounts of debt. Last I heard it is up in the $200,000 range in credit-card debt alone. Their house is not paid off and my father in-law is disabled. I refuse to pay for my sister in-lawâs luxurious lifestyle, but I am afraid after my in-laws pass we will be the only family with the financial capability to pay it off. In the event of them passing who will be responsible for their debt? Is there a way to protect my husband and I from being stuck with the bill?</p> <p>Not My Debt</p> <p>Dear Not My Debt,</p> <p>You had me at ââ¦$200,000 range in credit-card debt alone.â Thereâs a problem here and itâs bigger than your sister-in-law and her fiancÃ©. Your husbandâs parents are spending like there is literally no tomorrow without a care for their retirement, and your brotherâs sibling is taking advantage of their good (and, perhaps, reckless) nature.</p> <p>Podcast: Are millennials misunderstood or moochers?</p> http://video-api.wsj.com/api-video/player/iframe.html?guid=238E5600-E451-44A9-94CF-36C38749F0FF <p>To answer your question: No, sons and daughters are not liable for their parentsâ debts when they die. They sometimes have to oversee the estate if they are made executor of a will, but they donât have to pay for their parentsâ fiscally irresponsible behavior after theyâre gone. Your husbandâs parents are eating through their savings and racking up debt and, in doing so, eating through your husbandâs inheritance. Putting it more bluntly and philosophically, it looks increasingly like there will be no inheritance (if things continue as they have) so you canât lose what you never had.</p> <p>Read: Can my 40-year-old long-lost daughter get my estate?</p> <p>I think youâre asking the wrong question, however. What can you do to help them have a long and financially secure retirement? If your in-laws have a lawyer, call him/her, and bring in a certified financial planner or an accountant. You need to think not of yourself, but of your in-lawsâ future. Itâs time to call a family meeting â consider it a humanitarian mission. Offer to help them straighten out their finances and put it all down in black and white so they can see the kind of financial quagmire theyâre gotten themselves into.</p> <p>I think youâre asking the wrong question. What can you do to help them have a long and financially secure retirement?</p> <p>Iâve interviewed people who have incurred serious debt. One couple Iâve spoken to owed $89,000 on 11 credit cards, worked day and night to pay it off, and ate dehydrated, seasoned hash browns. They ate them with everything: Egg hash-brown casserole, eggs and hash browns, potato soup and hash browns, casserole with hash browns. It takes a long time to crawl your way out of a hole like the one your in-laws are digging for themselves with the help of their daughter and her husband.</p> <p>You donât want them to end up old, infirm and destitute. And it sounds like you are not in a position to support them, and you may have to if this continues. Not everything is elder abuse, but some children see dollar signs in the old family home. At the very least, your in-laws are being taken advantage of by these two moochers. They need to get a job and/or move out. You should at least give it a try. Itâs not your debt. But your in-laws financial future is at stake.</p> <p>Do you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, regifting, or any tricky money issues relating to family and friends? Send them to MarketWatchâsMoneyologist. </p> More from the Moneyologist <p>What happens to my husbandâs credit score if his kids default or die?</p> <p>Should I accept financial gifts from my family</p> <p>Should I pay my brotherâs $20,000 taxes and credit-card gambling debt?</p> <br /><br /><p><i>Quentin Fottrell is a personal finance reporter and <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/column/the-moneyologist\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">The Moneyologist</a> columnist for MarketWatch.

That has only continued ever since. Ahead of <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2016-rnc-primary-calendar/\" data-web-url=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2016-rnc-primary-calendar/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Saturday's Republican caucuses in Kansas, Kentucky and Maine and primary in Louisiana</a>, I sat down for a chat with RealClearPolitics' Sean Trende, one of my favorite political analysts, about strategic voting -- what strategies might work, where they would matter most, and how to see if this phenomenon was widespread. The following is a transcript of that chat, which has been lightly edited for clarity.</em></p><p><strong>Megan McArdle: </strong>As I see it, there are basically three strategies you can follow:</p>\n <ol>\n  <li>Anyone but Trump: It doesn't matter, as long as you vote against Trump. Democrats in open primary states can play, too.</li>\n  <li>Vote the leader: Pick the winner in your state, and force the nomination selection to the convention.</li>\n  <li>Attempt to generate an actual alternative front-runner by voting for the national poll leader, or the most plausible candidate -- probably Marco Rubio, given that he seems to have the most support from the highest number of GOP coalitions, but possibly Ted Cruz, since he appears to be the next most appealing to Trump voters.</li>\n </ol><p>I'll just start by asking: Which of these would someone follow if their main priority is to defeat Trump? Or am I thinking about it all wrong?</p><p><strong>Sean Trende</strong><strong>:</strong> No, I think you have it basically right. I actually think that, for now, their best chance lies behind Door No. 2.</p><p>Theoretically, Door No. 3 would be best -- unite behind the best possible alternative -- but no one seems to agree on who that is.Â So their best bet is to try to deny Trump wins in the winner-take-all states: Vote for John Kasich in Ohio, Rubio in Florida.</p><p>More from Bloomberg.com: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-04/bobby-van-s-is-empty-so-is-sparks-as-frazzled-traders-stay-away?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Why Wall Street's Iconic Steakhouses Are Empty</a></p><p>Door No. 1 is a recipe for what happened on Super Tuesday: a divided opposition that proves Ben Franklinâs famous remark that if revolutionaries donât all hang together, they all hang separately instead.</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>What about people in proportional delegate states? I saw some friends in Kentucky suggesting that it didn't matter, since they're not winner-take-all, and therefore Cruz voters should support Cruz, while Kasich and Rubio voters should push their guy.</p><p>More from Bloomberg.com: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-04/jim-rogers-there-s-a-100-probability-of-a-u-s-recession-within-a-year?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Jim Rogers: There's a 100% Probability of a U.S. Recession Within a Year</a></p><p><strong>ST: </strong>Yeah, but the narrative matters. Trump didn't do that spectacularly well on Super Tuesday -- a little more than a third of the votes -- but the headlines were great for him because he won so many states.</p><p>If Trump wins all these states outright, he grabs the headlines, and it is harder for the alternatives to gain momentum.</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>And what about the infamous \"Rule 40\" of the Republican convention, which says a candidate can't be on the ballot unless he's gotten a majority of the delegates in eight states? Does that change their calculation at all?</p><p>More from Bloomberg.com: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-04/oil-market-storm-clears-as-output-deal-seen-stabilizing-prices?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Oil Market Storm Clears as Prices Stabilize on Output Deal</a></p><p><strong>ST</strong><strong>:</strong> Y'know, that's a sort of giant unknown floating around out there.Â My guess is that Trump gets that threshold (he already has a majority of delegates in five states), so I have to believe the Rules Committee will axe the rule before the convention votes are taken. After all, it was designed to keep mischief makers out, not to prevent a floor debate whereby Trump wins by default.</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>Is any other candidate in any sort of position to hit the Rule 40 threshold?</p><p><strong>ST: </strong>It's hard to say, really.Â If we do somehow get down to two candidates soon, it could happen. But the field is winnowing almost painfully slowly, so I just don't think there's time.</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>A few days ago, my sense was that people were ready to line up behind either Cruz or Rubio. But that the feeling now is that there simply isn't time for the field to consolidate to the candidate they need, even if they started right now -- in part because it's still not clear who the better candidate is if you want to knock out Trump. Cruz has more delegates but less support outside of the states that have already voted.</p><p><strong>ST: </strong>That's right.Â It is just this bizarre, perfect storm of events that got us to this place.Â I think if Kasich had dropped out, you would have seen more of a stampede to Cruz or particularly Rubio. But with his decision to stay in, I think people realize the non-Tea Party/non-Trump lane (which is big!) is split, and that makes it hard to win outright.</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>So if you're a strategic voter, the thing to do is to check the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/\" data-web-url=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">RealClearPolitics poll average</a> for your state on the morning of the election, and vote for whichever candidate is leading there? (Note to readers: That shameless plug for Sean's fine site was not in any way solicited. I myself check it like one of those rats in lab experiments, pressing the little lever to get another pellet.)</p><p><strong>ST: </strong>Ha! Thank you for that.Â And I think that is absolutely correct (and you should check the site whether there is an election in your state or not!).</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>So the next question then: Where are the states where this will matter most? Florida, obviously. Ohio. What states should people be watching (outside of their own state, obviously)?</p><p><strong>ST: </strong>If it gets that far, California will be key.Â There are still a huge number of delegates there, and importantly, its congressional district delegates are awarded winner-take-all.</p><p>Which raises the fascinating question: Who votes in the Republican primary in the Compton district? Because they get the same number of delegates as voters in the Newport Beach district.</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>The Republican in Compton, take note: You are suddenly the most important person in America! A lonely nation turns its eyes to you!</p><p><strong>ST: </strong>Indeed.Â And there are a lot of those districts in CA.Â If we do somehow have a race where, say, 50 or 60 delegates separate the candidates, those voters will decide the nominee!</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>Say Trump wins one of the big winner-take-all states. How many other states, then, need to band together to deny him the nomination?</p><p><strong>ST: </strong>If he wins one of the winner-take-all states -- let's say Florida -- he's probably up to around 600 delegates or so.Â It could be higher depending on what happens in Illinois and North Carolina.Â But that's still a pretty <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-03/republicans-shift-to-last-ditch-plan-to-stop-trump-at-convention\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">far way away from 1,237</a>. So at that point, it's a war for California, New York (where you have to like Trump's chances) and especially Pennsylvania.</p><p>But candidates would have to keep going.Â I think Cruz would, but Rubio would have a hard time staying in after losing Florida, and Kasich really is mostly playing a spoiler role at this point, whether he knows it or not.</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>What are the odds that this will work? How likely is it that strategic voting can actually deny him the delegates he needs?</p><p><strong>ST: </strong>At this point, there's still a decent chance.Â Quite frankly, if Trump loses Florida and Ohio, I think he has a pretty hard time making it to 1,237. To be honest, the other \"pure\" winner-take-all states are pretty small: Delaware, Montana, Nebraska.Â New Jersey and Arizona are the only two substantial \"pure\" winner-take-all states after March 15.</p><p>If he sweeps those states, however, it's tough, especially if he does well in between.Â Overall, I think it's probably a 40 percent chance he gets stopped, which I sense is on the high side for most analysts.Â We'll have a much better sense the Tuesday after next.</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>So Florida and Ohio are basically the Gettysburg of the GOP counterinsurgency. They stop him there, or he probably sweeps forward to take the White House.</p><p>And do they know this? You live in Ohio: Do you see the troops amassing?</p><p><strong>ST: </strong>I think that's absolutely correct about Gettysburg.Â It's actually relatively quiet here, believe it or not.Â But I think the campaigns are gearing up for the big push (I saw my first John Kasich ad yesterday).Â After Michigan, all hell breaks loose.</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>And Rubio is reportedly canceling events everywhere else to stage his final stand in Florida.</p><p><strong>ST: </strong>That's pretty smart on his part.Â He can't afford to get blown out in places like Michigan, but if he can pull out 100 delegates in Florida, he's right back in this thing.</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>OK, the last question: If people are voting strategically on Saturday, who will they vote for in those four states? What would tell us whether that's a real factor, or just an isolated case of the Washington suburbs that nearly put Rubio over the top in Virginia?</p><p><strong>ST: </strong>Well, as much as I do love polls, they generally had Trump much stronger than he came out in the end in those states. So I think there's some evidence of this (and also potentially of some weakening in Trump's support).Â If we see Cruz do surprisingly well in Louisiana, while Rubio overperforms in Kentucky, or if Kasich collapses to below 5 percent, I think you'd say there's strategic voting going on (though with Carson exiting, we probably would expect Cruz to do better than the polls show).</p><p><strong>MM: </strong>Thank you, Mr.Â Trende, for providing your analysis. I'll be watching on Saturday.</p><p class=\"news-disclaimer-text\">This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.</p><p>More from Bloomberg.com</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-04/the-mystery-madoff-victims-who-left-2-5-billion-on-the-table?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">The Mystery Madoff Victims Who Left $2.5 Billion on the Table</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-04/payrolls-in-u-s-surge-while-wages-drop-in-mixed-jobs-report?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Payrolls in U.S. Surge While Wages Drop in Mixed Jobs Report</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-03/inside-china-s-plan-for-a-military-that-can-counter-u-s-muscle?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Inside Chinaâs Plan for a Military That Can Counter U.S. Muscle</a></li>\n </ul><p>Read <a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-03-04/the-anyone-but-trump-strategy-of-voting?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" rel=\"canonical\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">The 'Anyone But Trump' Strategy of Voting</a> on bloombergview.com</p> </p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"false","id":"af661d25-d115-3117-a107-c809dda00d70","categoryLabel":"Entertainment","cluster_id":"af661d25-d115-3117-a107-c809dda00d70","licensed":"false","title":"Judge Jeanine: Mitt Romney awoke a sleeping giant","link":"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4788291323001/judge-jeanine-mitt-romney-awoke-a-sleeping-giant/","summary":"The establishment is panicked and the former Republican presidential nominee just confirmed it","entities":"WIKIID:Mitt_Romney|WIKIID:Jeanine_Pirro","categories":"YCT:001000031","publisher":"Fox News","spaceid":"1197762606","hosted":false,"publicationDate":"4 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000031","score":"0.781955","label":"Arts & Entertainment"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["The establishment is panicked and the former Republican presidential nominee just confirmed it"],"remaining_body":[]},"cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":360,"width":640,"ratio":56.00000000000001,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/eYuvwaqpunQuEPURkcJUzA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0x/http://slingstone.zenfs.com/offnetwork/e23fb0612fe1daef4f2b28bf208d51dd","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/mY1IOSXSAwOlVTopirtN8w--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MQ--/http://slingstone.zenfs.com/offnetwork/e23fb0612fe1daef4f2b28bf208d51dd","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"false","id":"1f530632-c596-3736-8873-32de4d99574b","categoryLabel":"Politics","cluster_id":"1f530632-c596-3736-8873-32de4d99574b","licensed":"false","title":"Marco Rubio gets massacred","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/03/06/marco-rubio-gets-massacred/","summary":"âSuper Saturdayâ ended up being a Saturday night massacre for Marco Rubio.
