A bomb was smuggled onto the airplane, leading to the deaths of 219 Russians and 5 other crusaders only a month after Russia\u2019s thoughtless decision.\u201d\n\nAs for the deadly attacks in France, the ISIS magazine says that the terrorist group had not forgotten that French airstrikes against Islamic State militants began on Sept. 19, 2014, in Iraq. And the article said that the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had vowed revenge. \n\n\u201cThus the Islamic State dispatched its brave knights to wage war,\u201d the article says. \u201cThe eight knights brought Paris down on its knees, after years of French conceit in the face of Islam.\u201d  \n\nThe issue did not provide any further details in how the Paris attacks were carried out. \n\nThe cover of the English-language magazine shows emergency workers in Paris, and the title \"Just Terror.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/_davidthomson\/status\/666993046991540225\n\nThe image of the device recalls the sort of \"liquid bomb\" three British men were planning to use in 2006 to blow up flights over the Atlantic. They were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/09\/08\/world\/europe\/08britain.html\">convicted in 2009<\/a> of planning to <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/uk_news\/8242479.stm\">drain plastic soft-drink bottles with syringes and refill them<\/a> with concentrated hydrogen peroxide, a bleaching agent also used as a propellant for rockets.\n\nThat the bomb shown in the ISIS magazine seemed to include a switch on the detonator could raise the possibility that it might have been triggered by a bomber among the passengers. \n\n<em>Rukmini Callimachi reported from Paris, and Robert Mackey from New York.<\/em>","parent":{"ID":7600,"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/paris-attacks-live-updates\/","title":"Paris Attacks: Live Updates","prettytime":"Nov 13, 2015 5:14 pm","datetime":"2015-11-13 17:14:59","timestamp":1447452899,"tags":["victims"],"admin_limit":25,"fe_limit":6,"status":"publish","quicktags":[],"bylines":["The New York Times"],"keywords":["Paris Attacks (November 2015)"]},"date":"2015-11-18T11:35:40","modified":"2015-11-18T12:21:30","slug":"isis-brags-about-explosive-that-brought-down-russian-jet","guid":"346-isis-brags-about-explosive-that-brought-down-russian-jet-7957","excerpt":"","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America\/New_York","date_gmt":"2015-11-18T16:35:40","modified_tz":"America\/New_York","modified_gmt":"2015-11-18T17:21:30","meta":{"links":[]},"relative_time":"1H ago","prettytime":"Nov 18, 2015 11:35 am ET","timestamp":"11:35 am ET","datestamp":"Nov 18, 2015","time":1447864540,"link":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/paris-attacks-live-updates\/isis-brags-about-explosive-that-brought-down-russian-jet\/","shortlink":["http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1kEMWiD"],"admin_link":"http:\/\/live-admin.em.nytimes.com\/paris-attacks-live-updates\/isis-brags-about-explosive-that-brought-down-russian-jet\/","authors":[{"b_id":"18369","image":{"full":"","50":"","75":""},"twitter":"","facebook":"","email":"","website":"","scoop_id":"","title_case_name":"","name":"Rukmini Callimachi and Robert Mackey","slug":"rukmini-callimachi-and-robert-mackey"}],"content_expanded":"<div class=\"w592\"><figure class=\"media photo promo\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemid=\"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/11\/18\/world\/middleeast\/19DABIQ-WEB\/19DABIQ-WEB-tmagArticle.jpg\" itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/ImageObject\" role=\"group\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo<\/span><div class=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/paris-attacks-live-updates\/isis-brags-about-explosive-that-brought-down-russian-jet\/\"><img itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/11\/18\/world\/middleeast\/19DABIQ-WEB\/19DABIQ-WEB-tmagArticle.jpg\" src=\"http:\/\/graphics8.nytimes.com\/images\/2015\/11\/18\/world\/middleeast\/19DABIQ-WEB\/19DABIQ-WEB-tmagArticle.jpg\" id=\"100000004044584\" width=\"592\" height=\"473\" alt=\"A photograph from Dabiq, the Islamic State\u2019s online magazine, purporting to show the improvised explosive device used to bring down a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula last month.\"   \/><\/a><meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"473\"><meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"592\"><\/div><figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"description\"><span class=\"caption-text\">A photograph from Dabiq, the Islamic State\u2019s online magazine, purporting to show the improvised explosive device used to bring down a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula last month.<\/span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit<\/span> <\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility  for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/01\/world\/middleeast\/russian-plane-crashes-in-egypt-sinai-peninsula.html\">the downing of a Russian passenger plane over the Sinai Peninsula<\/a> last month, released an image that purports to show the improvised explosive device used to kill all 224 people aboard the flight from Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">In the latest issue of Dabiq, the Islamic State&#8217;s glossy online magazine, first disseminated through Telegram, an encrypted messaging app, a picture shows what ISIS says were the components of an IED: A Gold Schweppes Pineapple tonic water can and two devices containing wires that appear to be the detonator and the switch. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">It includes a caption that says, \u201cEXCLUSIVE \u2013 Image of the IED used to bring down the Russian airliner.\u201d <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The veracity of the claim, and whether or not the specific device shown was used in the attack, could not immediately be determined. American and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/18\/world\/europe\/russia-plane-crash-bomb.html\">Russian officials have said that the debris from the plane<\/a> suggests that there was a bomb on board.  <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The accompanying article in the ISIS magazine says that Russia\u2019s \u201carrogance\u201d in bombing Syria prompted their operatives in the Sinai Peninsula to change their plan from blowing up a plane from one of the countries participating in the American-backed coalition against ISIS to attacking a Russian airliner. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cIt was a rash decision of arrogance from Russia,\u201d the article says. \u201cAnd so after having discovered a way to compromise the security at the Sharm el Sheikh International Airport and resolving to bring down a plane belonging to a nation in the American-led Western coalition against the Islamic State, the target was changed to a Russian plane. A bomb was smuggled onto the airplane, leading to the deaths of 219 Russians and 5 other crusaders only a month after Russia\u2019s thoughtless decision.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">As for the deadly attacks in France, the ISIS magazine says that the terrorist group had not forgotten that French airstrikes against Islamic State militants began on Sept. 19, 2014, in Iraq. And the article said that the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had vowed revenge. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cThus the Islamic State dispatched its brave knights to wage war,\u201d the article says. \u201cThe eight knights brought Paris down on its knees, after years of French conceit in the face of Islam.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The issue did not provide any further details in how the Paris attacks were carried out. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The cover of the English-language magazine shows emergency workers in Paris, and the title &#8220;Just Terror.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"500\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">L&#39;Etat islamique diffuse le 12\u00e8me num\u00e9ro de sa revue anglophone &quot;Dabiq&quot;.
