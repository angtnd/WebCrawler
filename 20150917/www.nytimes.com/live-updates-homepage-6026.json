Trump \u2014 and neither was standing on the stage. \n\n<!-- more -->\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana was quick to aim at both. He mocked Mrs. Clinton by noting that a \"socialist\" is gaining on her. \"You can't make that up,\" he said. He then shifted to the dangers of the Republican Party nominating Mr. Trump. Either he will \"implode in a general election,\" Mr. Jindal said, adding that if \"God forbid\" Mr. Trump won the White House, no one knows what he would do. \n\nThe twin insults perfectly captured the sense of desperation among the struggling candidates. Their best hope to improve in the polls may be to prove their ability to tangle with those on top, during the Republican nomination fight and in a general election contest. \n\nIn the opening minutes, Mr. Jindal made it clear that flinging insults is crucial to that strategy.

Trump, the Republican front-runner in the polls whose campaign slogan, stitched on his trademark red cap, is \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nThe dig came from a president who has himself been accused by Republicans of not believing in American greatness, a charge leveled when he traveled abroad during his first term in what some critics called his \u201capology tour.\u201d It is also a central theme of a new book by former Vice President Dick Cheney, \u201cExceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America,\u201d in which Mr. Cheney argues that Mr. Obama has weakened the position of the United States in the world. \n\nOn Wednesday, the president dismissed what he called the \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d emanating from the presidential campaign trail and Republicans in general.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s winning right now. America\u2019s great right now,\u201d Mr. Obama said, quickly adding, \u201cWe can do even better.\u201d\n\nLater, Mr. Obama seemed unable to resist another veiled swipe at Mr. Trump, who argued during a Capitol Hill rally this month that the nuclear deal with Iran had been negotiated by \"totally incompetent people,\" and who routinely suggests that the president has been outfoxed and outmaneuvered.\n\n\"I\u2019m just going to go on a quick rant here for a second,\" Mr. Obama said in the middle of a discourse on the United States' relationship with China. \"This whole notion that somehow we're getting out-competed, out-dealt, out-this, out-that -- we're losing -- nobody outside the United States understands what we're talking about.\"

presidential debate, he did weigh in with a harsh assessment of the candidates, charging that they were \u201ctalking down America.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cIn the echo chamber that is presidential politics, everything is dark and everything is terrible,\u201d Mr. Obama said during remarks on the economy Wednesday at the Business Roundtable,  which includes dozens of chief executives from major corporations. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to offer any solutions to the disasters that they perceive, but they are quick to tell you who to blame.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cI\u2019m here to say that there\u2019s nothing particularly patriotic or American about talking down America,\u201d the president said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">While Mr. Obama did not mention him by name, the remarks seemed targeted at Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner in the polls whose campaign slogan, stitched on his trademark red cap, is \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The dig came from a president who has himself been accused by Republicans of not believing in American greatness, a charge leveled when he traveled abroad during his first term in what some critics called his \u201capology tour.\u201d It is also a central theme of a new book by former Vice President Dick Cheney, \u201cExceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America,\u201d in which Mr. Cheney argues that Mr. Obama has weakened the position of the United States in the world. <\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">On Wednesday, the president dismissed what he called the \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d emanating from the presidential campaign trail and Republicans in general.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cAmerica\u2019s winning right now. America\u2019s great right now,\u201d Mr. Obama said, quickly adding, \u201cWe can do even better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Later, Mr. Obama seemed unable to resist another veiled swipe at Mr. Trump, who argued during a Capitol Hill rally this month that the nuclear deal with Iran had been negotiated by &#8220;totally incompetent people,&#8221; and who routinely suggests that the president has been outfoxed and outmaneuvered.<\/p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">&#8220;I\u2019m just going to go on a quick rant here for a second,&#8221; Mr. Obama said in the middle of a discourse on the United States&#8217; relationship with China. &#8220;This whole notion that somehow we&#8217;re getting out-competed, out-dealt, out-this, out-that &#8212; we&#8217;re losing &#8212; nobody outside the United States understands what we&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;  <\/p>\n","highlight":false,"homepage":true,"standalone":true,"share_image":"","homepage_title":"","dateline":"","selected_tags":[],"tags":["chat","fact-check","video","photos","quotes"],"chat":false,"fact-check":false,"video":false,"photos":false,"quotes":false,"locked":0},{"ID":6055,"title":"Bobby Jindal Says \u201811th Commandment&#8217; Does Not Apply to Trump","status":"publish","type":"nyt_live_update","author":{"ID":86,"username":"lillie.dremeaux","name":"Lillie Dremeaux","first_name":"Lillie","last_name":"Dremeaux","nickname":"Lillie Dremeaux","slug":"lilliedremeaux","URL":"","avatar":"","description":"","registered":"2008-08-26T03:09:28-04:00"},"content":"[nytmedia id=\"100000003916367\" crop=\"592\" type=\"image\"]\n\nFor the four candidates in the Republican debate \"undercard\" tonight, one strategy to make sure that they are not entirely forgotten in the morning-after conversations and highlight reels is to go after Donald J.
