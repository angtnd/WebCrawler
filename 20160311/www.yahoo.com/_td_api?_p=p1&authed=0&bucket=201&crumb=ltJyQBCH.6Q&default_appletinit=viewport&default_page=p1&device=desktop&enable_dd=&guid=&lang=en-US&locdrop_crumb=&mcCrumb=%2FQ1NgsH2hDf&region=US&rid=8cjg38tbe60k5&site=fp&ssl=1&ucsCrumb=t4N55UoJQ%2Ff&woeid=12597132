PALM BEACH, Fla. â Donald Trump formally won the endorsement of former rival Ben Carson â a potentially significant show of support as the Republican frontrunner seeks to unify the party behind his insurgent campaign for president. </p>","<p> The retired neurosurgeon joined Trump at a Friday morning press conference here at the real estate mogulâs Mar-a-Lago Club, praising him as a âvery intelligent man who cares deeply about America.â </p>","<p> âThere are two different Donald Trumps,â Carson said as he addressed reporters from a small stage inside an ornate ballroom here. âThereâs the one you see on the stage, and thereâs the one who is very cerebral, sits there and considers things very carefully; you can have a very good conversation with him. And thatâs the Donald Trump you are going to start seeing more and more of.â </p>","<p> Asked later if he agreed with Carson that there are two sides of him, Trump at first said yes. âI think there are two Donald Trumps. Thereâs the public version and people see that, and I donât know what they see exactly â¦ but itâs probably different than the personal Donald Trump,â the real estate mogul said. âI am somebody thatâs a thinker. â¦ I have my ideas and they are strong.â </p>","<p> But pressed further on the subject a few minutes later, Trump reversed himself. âI donât think there are two Donald Trumps,â he said. âI am who I am.â</p>","<p> Carsonâs backing comes a week after the retired neurosurgeon suspended his own bid for the presidency, and it was announced as Trump tries to assume the role of the partyâs presumptive nominee and to appear more presidential. But though he has talked up his desire and ability to unify the party, itâs still unclear what steps Trump is actually taking to do that. </p>","<p> The GOP frontrunner said that he has been on the receiving end of phone calls from Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. But he repeatedly ignored a question from Yahoo News about whether he himself is personally doing any outreach to members of the party alarmed by the prospect that he could become the nominee or whether he believes that to be something he should be doing. </p>","<p> At the same time, it was not clear whether Trump asked for Carsonâs endorsement or if it was offered. Carson ignored the question. When asked by Yahoo News if he had sought Carsonâs backing, Trump replied, âItâs something I wanted.â </p>","<figure width=\"3000\" height=\"2179\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/0uN7L7QOtEwUFa_tFS_eJw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/57e1d3b034d38263376765ffad9edeef/tumblr_inline_o3vulq380z1tou6vb_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"464.85333333333335\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>"],"remaining_body":["<p><i>Donald Trump takes questions during a press conference with former rival Ben Carson, who endorsed him on Friday. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</i><br /></p>","<p>Carson, a first-time candidate, briefly led polls in early voting states like Iowa, thanks in part to his enormous popularity among evangelical voters. But he was unable to translate that support into actual wins, in spite of raising and spending tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions, mostly from small donors. </p>","<p> Carsonâs support came two weeks after Trump won the backing of another former GOP rival, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Though exit polls suggest Trump is already doing well with evangelical voters, Carson could potentially help the real estate mogul further consolidate that vote away from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has stepped up his appeals to values voters as he seeks to cast himself as the clear Trump alternative in the race. </p>","<p> In many ways, Carsonâs endorsement of Trump was no surprise. Though the retired doctor said earlier this week that he was open to backing Trump or Cruz, Carson was angry at what he described as âdirty tricksâ by the senator and his aides in Iowa. As voters there headed to caucus, Cruz aides and supporters had falsely spread word that Carson was suspending his campaign for the White House. The Carson campaign blamed those rumors for his disappointing fourth place finish in the state. </p>","<p> At first, Cruz tried to blame the media â citing a CNN report that said Carson was returning home to Florida after the Iowa caucuses. But he later apologized to Carson â both publicly and later in a private meeting inside a tiny closet at a South Carolina forum â though their relationship never recovered. </p>","<p> Speaking to reporters on Friday, Carson said he had forgiven Cruz â because thatâs what a Christian should do, he told reporters. But he added that the Texas senator had not asked for his endorsement. </p>","<figure width=\"2960\" height=\"2081\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/bNN1VAKeCKf.oAQlvucBYg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/06e1775ec106899ed7cc32dd2d9d28cf/tumblr_inline_o3vv3bVIUD1tou6vb_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"449.94594594594594\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Carson shakes hands with Trump on Friday after announcing his endorsement of the Republican frontrunner. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</i><br /></p>","<p>Carson seemed to be more forgiving toward Trump, who at times had viciously attacked his GOP rival on the campaign trail. Last fall, when Carson briefly surpassed Trump as the GOP frontrunner in early polling, the real estate mogul seized on reports that Carson had exaggerated aspects of his personal biography, including a story that heâd been offered a full scholarship to West Point.

Manziel likely must address his reported substance concerns that had him in rehab a year ago and also decide if he's willing to commit to being an NFL player at the game's most demanding position.</p>","<p>The Browns took a leap of faith, moving back first in the first round and then up, to land Manziel. They saw his magical penchant for making plays in college and overlooked other shortcomings: yes, his size and pro-style quarterbacking ability, but more important his inability to stay out of trouble and spend the time necessary to work his craft.</p>","<p>There were glimmers of greatness over his two seasons, but they were cloaked by mistakes on and off the field, not to mention the frustration of a Browns coaching staff and front office that largely were gutted by owner Jimmy Haslam, whom many people believe green-lit (and perhaps even insisted on) the Manziel pick.</p>","<p>In eight starts with the Browns, Manziel completed 57 percent of his passes, threw for seven TDs and seven interceptions and rushed for 259 yards and a touchdown. His magic never really translated on the field â certainly not anywhere close to the level to offset his frustrating off-field incidents.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>The Browns drafted him over Derek Carr and Teddy Bridgewater and still find themselves in need of a quarterbacks, owners of the No. 2 overall pick in the draft and having lost their top four unrestricted free agents.

I literally had moms saying how they want toÂ feel safe knowing that if they haveÂ a kid goingÂ to jail, at least heâs not going to getÂ drugs.Â In the Clark County Jail, you could actually get more drugs inside andÂ cheaper than you could get on the outside. W</span><span style=\"\">e started attempting to make some changes but the inmate culture doesnât want toÂ talk to corrections, they donât want to talk to me as sheriff because they donât want to be viewed as a snitch. AndÂ the culture of some of the corrections officers is such that sometimesÂ they donât want to admit that weâre doing something wrong. B</span><span style=\"\">ecause of the illegal activity thatâs running rampant, I had to arrest a few of our own employees.Â </span></p> \n <p><span style=\"\">My initial thought was to put undercover police officers in the facility but my concern was I wouldnât get the stuff that I was looking for â inmate behavior, inmate movements. W</span><span style=\"\">e started gettingÂ a lot of local media coverage because weÂ were doing these searches.Â I got a phone call from a production company saying they had an interest in what weâreÂ trying to do. </span><span style=\"\">So, we kinda mutually suggestedÂ putting a regular person in.Â </span></p> \n <p><strong>Where did you put the cameras?</strong><br /><span style=\"\">They came in and installed some pretty high-tech cameras that weâve never had in our facility before. Inmates signed a waver to agree to be in that section [where the cameras were]. We were able to basically monitor them around the clock. E</span><span style=\"\">very once in a while an inmate would say, âHey, I donât want to be part of the show.Â I donât want to agree to be taped.âThey would be moved to a different section of the jail.Â </span></p> \n <p><strong><span style=\"\">Doesnât that get in the way of your trying to uncover secrets about the place if you let them know youâre filming?</span></strong><br /><span style=\"\">Well, we had to let âem know that we wereÂ filming a show and the amazing part about it is â¦Â they get so used to them being there that they forget. W</span><span style=\"\">hen itâs a known thing and itâs right there in front of you, people kind of get used to it and goÂ about their normal business.</span></p> \n <p><strong><span style=\"\">Did the inmates know that you putÂ regular Joes in the jail, they werenâtÂ actual criminals?</span></strong><br /><span style=\"\">No, they did not know that.Â </span><span style=\"\">They did not know that they were helping me in an undercover capacity.Â And I didnât let them know, because I didnât want them to be branded as a snitch or put in an unsafe situation.Â </span></p> \n <p><strong><span style=\"\">I notice that these volunteers were prepped for their time in prison.Â How do you prep them? Â </span></strong><br /><span style=\"\">There were certain code words and different gestures that people monitoring immediately knew that if they saw that, that the person would be, within seconds, pulled out of that sectionÂ released from the facility.</span></p> \n <p><strong><span style=\"\">Did any of them do that or did they all stay in?</span></strong><br /><span style=\"\">Well, I donât want to tip too much but yes,Â there were some incidents where people did leave.</span></p> \n <p><strong><span style=\"\">Did you prepare them for the possibility that they could be involved in a fight somehow or anything like that?</span></strong><br /><span style=\"\">Yeah, they were.Â They were told that, hey, this is jail.Â This is what could happen.Â So, even though it was a lowÂ risk they understand that it could happen but they were also briefed, too, that, hey, if youâre in this facility for up to 60 days and you start getting comfortable yourself, it doesnât give you carte blanche to commit a criminal act yourself.Â </span></p> \n <p><em>60 Days In</em> premieres Thursday at 9Â p.m. ET on A&E.</p> \n <p><div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe title=\"YouTube\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 youtube pushTop\" src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/7j3wzvNkh1U\"> frameborder=â0â allowFullScreen></iframe></div></p> \n</div>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"celebrity","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":397,"width":640,"ratio":62,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/PX1pWoFKyq2FUZ8WaQZQow--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/entertainment_weekly_785/92d8fb3f12675e03d414be662bf69036","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/UMH8CobRB6kEJolOtNTHWQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/entertainment_weekly_785/92d8fb3f12675e03d414be662bf69036","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"50728b2b-2a49-36ad-af24-0e9a7647671a","licensed":"true","title":"Duck Dynasty Clan: Vote for Hillary, We Dare You","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/duck-dynasty-clan-vote-hillary-000000007.html","summary":"If hunters want to keep the tradition alive, then it&#39;s time to lean left.","entities":"WIKIID:Public_land","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000071","publisher":"Ozy","author":"Meghan Walsh","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/a1J1s9UFt4AfeMHM048w8w--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/news/2015-06-29/e65d2e00-1e88-11e5-ad9a-772eb5c96093_press-ozy-logo.jpg","provider_url":"http://www.ozy.com/","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"7645365","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"7645365","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Public_land;Rural_area;Conservation_movement;Environmental_issue;Hunting;Hillary_Clinton;Duck_Dynasty\" rs=\"lmsid:a0Vd000000AEgayEAD;revsp:ozy.media.com;lpstaid:50728b2b-2a49-36ad-af24-0e9a7647671a\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"17 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo - ABC News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000071","score":"0.7","label":"Books"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>Sometimes the stereotypes are true. Most hunters really are rural, male, white, old â¦ and conservative. Many are lifetime card-carrying members of the NRA and <a href=\"http://www.ozy.com/provocateurs/alan-korwin-the-accidental-gun-advocate/61652\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Second Amendment stalwarts</a>. Itâs safe to say there arenât a lot of Hillary supporters in this good ole boysâ club.</p>","<p>But thereâs another side to the story. Hunting folk are also dedicated conservationists and defenders of public land, which puts them in direct opposition to their Republican brethren. The reality is you canât hunt without public land to track or animals to stalk â and itâs the Dems who have the better record on conservation and environmental issues. Hunters are told itâs either red or blue. <a href=\"http://www.ozy.com/true-story/haunted-by-hunting-guns/64534\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Guns</a>Â or land.</p>","<p>But what if AmericaâsÂ camo-shaded gunslingers, already standing on fissured political ground, took a full-on leap into the ideological abyss?Â Willie Robertson and the rest of the Duck Dynasty family, I dare you: Vote for Hillary.</p>","<p>If they did, I hazard, we might have a good, ahem, shot atÂ <a href=\"http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/its-the-end-of-the-world-how-do-you-feel/62757\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">saving Americaâs backcountry</a>. And just maybe, guns will go back to what they once were â a survival tool, not a statement.Â âItâs not an either/or proposition,â says Randy Newberg, host of the popular hunting TV shows <em>Fresh Tracks</em> and <em>On Your Own Adventures,Â </em>as well as a born and bred conservative lifetime member of the NRA. âWeâve let ourselves be pigeonholed in the political world.â</p>","<p>It wasnât always like this. Going back to the 1800s, hunters have been at the forefront of the conservation movement, and the reason is simple. Few understand the land or are as invested in its health as the ones who rely on it for food. To this day, hunters and anglers pay a huge chunk of nature restoration costs.Â At one point, the NRA was even on the same side as conservationists, but as politics have shifted and splintered, the same politicians seen as pro-gun champions of rural America are now the ones selling the land from right under their constituents. And I think most can agree that selling public land to private interests is not entirely based on ideological principle; itâs about the Benjamins.Â </p>","<p>So rather than see your dollars go to waste, remind the GOP itâs not just about AK-47s but also rifles and bighorn sheep and feeding families with fresh, organic game.Â Look, Iâm not saying you have to lean left forever â just long enough to remind the ones at the top of the ladder who really has the power. After all, at stake is a way of life that goes back much farther than political parties. âWe like to say you can get our guns when you pry them from our cold, dead hands,â Newberg says. âWell, you can get this land when you pry it from my cold, dead hands.âÂ </p>","<p><strong>Related Articles</strong>\n <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/in-uruguay-everything-happens-every-week/1538\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">In Uruguay, Everything Happens, Every Week</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.ozy.com/pov/do-tattoos-have-a-place-in-politics/3478\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Do Tattoos Have a Place in Politics?</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.ozy.com/acumen/the-surprising-voting-habits-of-smokers/60675\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">The Surprising Voting Habits of Smokers</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.ozy.com/pov/child-rearing-a-decades-long-exercise-in-selfishness/3231\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Child Rearing: A Decades-Long Exercise in Selfishness? </a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/from-email-to-picture-frame/60606\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">From Email to Picture Frame</a></li>\n </ul></p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"news","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":480,"width":640,"ratio":75,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/PPaX1pTpnAxp00zYUI0oiA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ozy.media.com/3348140120261d9ce0f599d74ae4a11d","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/DQLuOgrSGktJJKoWqdB8MA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ozy.media.com/3348140120261d9ce0f599d74ae4a11d","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"9c22b6f9-bdb6-3d64-a0ec-71ea0def0d46","licensed":"true","title":"Tonight Was the Night the Republican Establishment Gave Up","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/tonight-night-republican-establishment-gave-040400842.html","summary":"Conceding to reality.","entities":"WIKIID:Donald_Trump|WIKIID:Marco_Rubio|WIKIID:Ted_Cruz","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000671","publisher":"Mic","author":"Luke Brinker","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/DpvbHc..j7jjEG63GGc2Ig--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2015-11-03/ce2ef190-826c-11e5-aa20-11edc1bddb46_eaf30c75842567f61d25dd021e031144.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://mic.com/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=readMore&utm_campaign=partner","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"7645365","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"7645365","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Donald_Trump;Marco_Rubio;Ted_Cruz;John_Kasich;Hillary_Clinton\" ctopid=\"1996000\" hashtag=\"1996000\" rs=\"lmsid:a0Vd000000Ca67WEAR;revsp:mic_26;lpstaid:9c22b6f9-bdb6-3d64-a0ec-71ea0def0d46\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"13 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo - ABC News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000671","score":"0.7","label":"Elections"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>\n <div class=\"article-body-content\">\n  <p class=\"\">#<a href=\"http://theresurgent.com/the-importance-of-disclosing-this-immediately/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">NeverTrump</a>?

Ted Cruz of Texas.</p>","<p>Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Gov. John Kasich all steered clear of open confrontation with Trump for much of the night on the debate stage at the University of Miami. It was clear that all the candidates, even Trump, were aware that the nasty tone of the last two debates had turned off many voters.</p>","<p>The tepid atmosphere seemed to suit Trump, who held himself back this time from insulting the other candidates, in a departure from his recent practice. There were no references to âlittle Marco,â no labeling of Cruz as ânastyâ or a âliar.â</p>","<p>Trump has shown signs of trying to soften his roughest edges in the last few months, as he has tightened his grip on the Republican nomination. And more than ever Thursday, he sought to portray himself as more presidential than he has often appeared.</p>","<p>After the debate, Trump referred to the evening as âelegant.â</p>","<p>Yet as the debate wore on, and the moderators pressed in with questions on foreign policy matters, Trump was unable to offer specific proposals or ideas and was bested by Cruz and Rubio on a number of points.</p>","<p>Trumpâs lack of policy experience has failed to hold him back so far, and itâs not clear it will now. But it was visibly on display during this debate, whether it was boasting of having walked in a parade to boost his pro-Israel credentials, or talking at length about getting a better âdealâ with the Cuban government âwithout giving any specifics.</p>","<p>Trump stumbled most, however, over the question of his praise for despotic government overseas.</p>","<p>CNNâs Jake Tapper asked Trump why he had recently praised the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin,Â <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/trump-praises-putin-216929\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">brushing aside concerns</a> about the killing of his political opponents and journalists, and why Trump had also <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/432036/donald-trump-tiananmen-square\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">commented favorably</a>Â on the Chinese governmentâs crushing of student protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p>","<p>âThey put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength,â Trump said in 1990, a year after the protests.</p>","<p>Trump reacted defensively, denying that he intended to indicate his approval of the Russian and Chinese leaders.</p>","<p>âThat doesnât mean I was endorsing that. I was not endorsing it,â he said.</p>","<p>But Trump did double down on his praise for Putin, saying that he âhas been a very strong leader for Russia.â</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>âI think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you,â Trump said. He added the caveat that he was not âendorsing Putin.â</p>","<p>Tapper pursued the question again, noting that âthe word âstrongâ obviously is a complimentâ and arguing that Trump was speaking in glowing terms about government leaders who had committed âatrocitiesâ against their own people.</p>","<p>Trump at first avoided the question, talking instead about German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But then, against all evidence and logic, he denied the premise of Tapperâs question.</p>","<p>âAnd âstrongâ doesnât mean good. Putin is a strong leader, absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I donât say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact,â Trump said.</p>","<p>Earlier in the night, Trump also tried to back off comments he made <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/mar/01/conservative-solutions-pac/would-donald-trump-be-neutral-between-israel-and-i/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">earlier this year </a>that he would take a âneutralâ position in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>","<p>Trump attempted to reassure voters and supporters of Israel that he was in fact on their side. To argue this point, he used the fact that he was âthe grand marshal, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down Fifth Avenue.â</p>","<p>There was audible laughter in the audience.</p>","<p>Trumpâs answer on the matter of U.S. relations with Cuba also was light on specifics. Last September, heÂ said it was âfineâ for President Obama to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/08/politics/donald-trump-cuba-diplomatic-opening/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba</a>, though he noted that he did not think the United States had negotiated a good âdealâ with the Cubans.</p>","<p>On Thursday night, Trump again hammered the deal with Cuba, and brought up the argument raised recentlyÂ that the United States owes reparations to the communist island nation, slamming the idea as foolish.</p>","<p>âI would want to make a good deal. I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal,â Trump said.</p>","<p>When CNNâs Dana Bash pressed Trump on whether heâd keep the U.S. embassy in Havana open, as a symbol of renewed diplomatic relations, Trump reversed his previous position on the issue and said he would âprobably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made.â</p>","<p>He never explained what such a deal would entail.</p>","<p>Rubio, whose parents arrived from Cuba in 1956, delivered a strong response to Trump, explaining in great detail what he thought a good deal would look like. This received an overwhelmingly positive response from the hometown crowd.</p>","<p>But it was Cruz who honed in many times during the night on Trumpâs weak grasp of policy detail.</p>","<p>Trump was asked about having said that he would target the families of terrorists and have them killed. Tapper pointed out that this would violate the Geneva Conventions, and asked Trump to defend this claim.</p>","<p>Trump avoided the question, but moments later, CruzÂ took him on directly, while defending the right of the American people to be worried about terrorist attacks.</p>","<p>âPeople are scared. And for seven years, weâve faced terrorist attacks, and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia. That is maddening,â Cruz said. âBut the answer is not simply to yell, âChina bad, Muslims bad.â Youâve got to understand the nature of the threats weâre facing, and how you deal with them.â</p>","<p>Trumpâs simplistic solutions have played well so far with Republican voters, however, and the many contradictions between his past statements and current positions have failed to stop his momentum in this primary.</p>","<p>Brendan Buck, the chief spokesman for House Speaker Paul D.

By turning this into an either/or situation, you may be talking past each other instead of with each other. <p> While you crave peace and quiet at the end of the day, he worries that you are isolating yourself. Friendships aren't supposed to drain people; they are supposed to be nurturing.

My rebound relationship lasted a decade and produced a beautiful baby boy. After it recently ended, I reached out to Tammy. We hadn't communicated in 10 years, and I learned that she is married with three kids and she's miserable. <p> She said she misses me and has never stopped loving me. We talk on the phone often, and she says she wants to see me. I have no idea where this is going, but I'd love to see her. We have decided that we will abide by your advice. What should I do? -- NOSTALGIC IN NEW YORK<p> DEAR NOSTALGIC: I'm glad you asked, although I doubt you will heed my advice. Here it is: You and Tammy should postpone any reunions until she has resolved her marital situation because there are more people involved now than just the two of you. Whether she remains in her unhappy marriage is anyone's guess, but if you step in now, it will only add to her troubles.<p> \n          <hr size=\"1\" width=\"75%\" noshade=\"\" align=\"center\">\n            DEAR ABBY: How do I respond to a gift when I don't know whether or not it's a gag gift?
