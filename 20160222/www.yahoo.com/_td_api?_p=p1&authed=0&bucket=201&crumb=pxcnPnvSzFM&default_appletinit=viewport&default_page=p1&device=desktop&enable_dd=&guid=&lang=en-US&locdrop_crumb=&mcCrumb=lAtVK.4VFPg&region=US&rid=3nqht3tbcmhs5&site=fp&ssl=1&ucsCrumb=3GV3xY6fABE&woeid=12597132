Authorities were investigating unconfirmed reports he may have picked up passengers in the hours before and after the rampage on Saturday.</p>","<p>San Francisco-based Uber has been one of the most successful tech industry startups in recent years, as millions of customers have flocked to use its smartphone app for hailing rides in 380 cities around the globe. The company says its drivers are independent contractors who use the app to help find customers and schedule trips.</p>","<p>Private backers have poured more than $10 billion into the company, under terms that value the business at more than $50 billion â making it the biggest in a recent wave of tech firms that have grown to enormous size without taking the traditional step of selling stock to the public.</p>","<p>But since its launch in 2009, Uber has faced criticism for a pricing formula that can send rates skyrocketing at times of high demand, and for side-stepping regulators and licensing requirements in some cities where it's opened for business. And after several reported assaults by drivers, critics have also complained the company should do more to screen drivers and guard passengers' safety.</p>","<p>Some of that criticism has been raised by competitors and regulators who argue that Uber's success has come as the company has expanded while seeking to avoid the strict licensing and permit requirements that traditional tax companies face.</p>","<p>\"I do think this is an outrageous incident that's going to draw more attention to this issue,\" said Dave Sutton, spokesman for \"Who's Driving You,\" an organization backed by Uber's competitors in the taxi and limousine industry, which has fought the company's expansion.</p>","<p>Authorities identified Dalton as a 45-year-old from Kalamazoo Township who police said had no criminal record.

Hourdajian wouldn't say whether he was picking up fares for the ride-sharing service Saturday night.</p>","<p>Authorities, however, were investigating a Facebook post which indicated the suspect was driving erratically around the time of the shootings and may have picked up at least one Uber fare while authorities were looking for him, according to Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting.</p>","<p>Uber said Sunday that it has offered to assist authorities in their investigation. In a statement, Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan said the company is \"horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence.\"</p>","<p>While Uber says it screens drivers and conducts background checks, critics say the ride-hailing company uses private screening services that don't have access to as much information as local police can obtain when they check fingerprint records.</p>","<p>The company said earlier this month that it will pay $28.5 million to settle two lawsuits that alleged Uber misled customers about safety procedures and fees. It's also facing a separate a lawsuit by district attorneys in San Francisco and Los Angeles, who alleged that Uber's checks failed to prevent the company from hiring several felons.</p>","<p>If Dalton had no criminal record, it's not clear that Uber would have had any reason to keep him from driving. Uber, meanwhile, instituted a policy last year that prohibits driver and passengers from possessing firearms. Anyone found to be in violation of the policy may be prohibited from using or driving for the service.</p>","<p>While there have been several cases in which Uber drivers have been charged with assaulting passengers, there have also been incidents in which the company's drivers have been attacked by passengers.</p>","<p>Uber has also faced complaints that one of its executives in New York used information collected by the Uber app to track a passenger's movements.

(Photo: Liz Goodwin/Yahoo News)</i></p>","<p>LAS VEGAS â Jimmy Vaccaro has run sports betting in various casinos in Las Vegas for 40 years now. He could quickly calculate the spread for next yearâs opening football weekend in his head, but it wasnât until last summer that he began to get interested in the Super Bowl of politics â the presidential election.<br /></p>","<p>âIâve been here nine elections so far or something like that,â Vaccaro said. âNo one ever asked about it.â<a></a></p>","<p>In August, that began to change. Customers came up to the gleaming sports book counter at South Point Casino and asked if they could place their money on real estate tycoon Donald Trump instead of the Giants. Vaccaro didnât like turning them away, so he began releasing weekly odds sheets, calculating each candidateâs chances to win the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations. The sheet is emblazoned with the words âFOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY,â since political betting is for the most part outlawed in the United States.</p>","<p>Bettors at South Point, a working-class casino a few miles from the Strip that is filled with locals and some vacationers, would take the sheets and begin arguing about their favorites.</p>","<p>âWe deal mostly with Middle America,â Vaccaro said. âWe donât have the Asian high rollers, the billionaires. These are the people who are going to make the difference [in the election].â </p>","<p>Theyâre also Trumpâs base. The Republican frontrunner held a rally at the casino last month, which quickly reached capacity. The overflow filled the hundreds of chairs in the sports book section, and Vaccaro realized this election was going to be different.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>âFor years and years and years no one would even be talking about this stuff probably at least until the Super Tuesday thing,â Vaccaro said. âSo for the first time maybe in our history weâve got a lot of people saying, âI want to try to do something with my vote this year.ââ</p>","<p><b><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/winners-losers-c-nevada-010438787/photo-disappointment-1456073737967.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"><i>SLIDESHOW â Winners and losers in South Carolina and Nevada</i> >>></a></b></p>","<p>Vaccaroâs weekly predictions brought the Pennsylvania native a flood of media attention. Heâs been on CNN, MSNBC and âThe Daily Show.â âI did CNN with that Brooke Baldwin lady, and she said whoâs going to win the [nomination], and I said Trump,â he recalled. But Vaccaro also realizes that his ultimate goal â to legalize political betting in the country â is futile. âThe Constitution has to be changed, thatâs how crazy this is from what I understand,â he said. (Federal and state laws restrict gambling on politics except for some small-stakes predictions websites.) It âbugsâ Vaccaro to watch overseas betting sites raking in cash from political betting while he has to stand by.</p>","<p>All the same, his for-fun political odds sheets have helped make the casino into a center of political activity.</p>","<p>Trump is returning to South Point Casino on Monday for an evening rally in an arena that can fit 8,000 people. His message has resonated in a state that was among the hardest hit in the recession.</p>","<p>Vaccaro took a personal hit as well, buying a house for $270,000 at the height of the housing boom that quickly lost half its value. Heâs a bookie, not a financier. âIâm the worst businessman in the world, but this, this is just natural. The other thing, I ainât got a clue, kid. Stick with what you know.â</p>","<p>Vaccaro understands Trumpâs appeal, and predicted he would win the nomination back when he was a 20-to-1 underdog. âWe know it ainât no good out there, so weâre thinking, who the hell maybe would help change things a little bit. Thatâs what the attitude is of what I call the average guy,â he said. </p>","<p>Vaccaro plans to caucus Tuesday and so far is leaning toward supporting Trump. He also thinks Trump will most likely take the state. âTrump Iâd give about a dollar 50, which is like 3 to 2,â he said. âAnd Cruz and Rubio, plus a dollar 30.â That means theyâre both slight underdogs. </p>","<p>But Vaccaro is cautious about his prediction. âEveryone was betting on the Carolina Panthers two months ago, too, and they got their butts whupped, so things change quickly.â</p>"]},"property":"politics","images":[{"caption":"Jimmy the bookie handicaps the election, from a front-row seat","id":"e6341957-a3db-3cd6-aa33-24418428c494","title":"Jimmy the bookie handicaps the election, from a front-row seat","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Jimmy the bookie handicaps the election, from a front-row seat","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/j3L_CtLSzJt3ueF_dNatkQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/427f55c372e43137cbc8d3f43d6565f6","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"RNC Will Support Whoever Wins Nomination, Even Donald Trump (ABC News)","id":"d2dfcdc5-8d2e-3d88-aec5-738db4c53f75","title":"RNC Will Support Whoever Wins Nomination, Even Donald Trump","type":"photo","shortCaption":"RNC Will Support Whoever Wins Nomination, Even Donald Trump (ABC News)","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/nq74WJWA1DT2iLujTYbR2A--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O2lsPXBsYW5lO3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.go.com/GTY_reince_priebus_jt_160220_16x9_992.jpg","alt":"RNC Will Support Whoever Wins Nomination, Even Donald Trump"},"index":2},{"caption":"Supporters of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump celebrate the close of the polls, as they watch election results at a rally in Spartanburg, S.C., Feb. 20, 2016. \n (Photo: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)","id":"d71d51a9-50da-3a43-852a-5ffca347a20e","title":"Trump projected as winner","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Supporters of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump celebrate the close of the polls, as they watch election results at a rally in Spartanburg, S.C., Feb. 20, 2016. \n (Photo: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/TcMjRzGH8tQ5VovlQUKCiQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/f8ec220ecdb34d48029895e8d5240641","alt":"Trump projected as winner"},"index":3},{"caption":"Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at his 2016 New Hampshire presidential primary election night rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, February 9, 2016.

Will our lives be the same? Are we going to be OK?!â Of course, I expected it to be different but, wow, it really is so hard!â</p>","<p>Kim continued, âWhen I had North, all I did was feed and sleep. This time around, I get no sleep. Every waking second that Iâm not with the baby, Iâm with North. I actually think the harder parts arenât with the newborn but with the toddler! I feel like I go into overdrive to give my daughter attention and make her feel loved. I know we will soon get into the perfect groove and just figure it out.

data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Kesha Denied Dr. Luke Injunction, Must Record for Sony</a></p>","<p>âIn a show of support, Taylor Swift has donated $250,000 to Kesha to help with any of her financial needs during this trying time,â a spokesperson forÂ Swift wrote in a statement.</p>","<p>Swift is the latest singer to show support for Kesha after the trial, with Lady Gaga, Lorde, <a

backÂ the singer.</p>","<p>âThere are people all over the world who love you Kesha,â Gaga wrote.Â \"And I can say truly I am in awe of your bravery.â</p>","<p>âStanding with KeshaÂ through this traumatic, deeply unfair time,â added Lorde. âSend good vibes her way, everyone.â</p>","<p>Over the weekend, Demi Lovato wrote a series of tweets supporting Kesha and exemplifyingÂ women empowerment.</p>","<p>â#FreeKesha. This is only gonna make you stronger, you brave and beautiful girl,â Lovato wrote. âPrayers are with you.Â Frustrating to see women come forward with their past only to be shot down, not believed and disrespected for their bravery in taking action.Â Happens way too often. Iâm ready for women to be taken just as seriously as men.Â Someone tell me why anyone would ever feel brave enough to come forward if they are most likely to be ignored or called a liar?â</p>","<p>Lovato also wrote that she was âready for self-proclaimed feminists to start speaking out or taking action for womenâs rights,â which some fans interpreted as a subtle dig at Swift. However, multiple sources connected to Swift tell <i>Rolling Stone</i> that there was no connection between Lovatoâs tweets and the donation. âWhen Taylor saw the heartbreaking courtroom photosÂ of Kesha, it was then that she knew she needed to do something,â a source close to Swift says.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>On Friday, New York Supreme Court Justice Shirley Kornreich sided with Dr. Luke and Sony at Keshaâs hearing, telling the singer'sÂ legal team, âYouâre asking the court to decimate a contract that was heavily negotiated and typical for the industry.\"Â Keshaâs lawyer Mark Geragos asked for an injunction because, as he told the judge, the career of a pop star is often brief, and Keshaâs career could be \"irreparably harmedâ if she did not return to recording music.</p>","<p>âThere has been no showing of irreparable harm. Sheâs being given opportunity to record,â Judge Kornreich said in denying the injunction. Kesha will have to record six more albumsÂ under Kemosabe Records, Dr. Lukeâs Sony imprint, according to theÂ <i>New York Daily News</i>.</p>","<p>âWe are pleased with the Courtâs decision from the bench fully denying Ms. Sebertâs motion for a preliminary injunction,â Christine Lepera, Dr. Lukeâs attorney, toldÂ <i>Rolling StoneÂ </i>Friday. âAs the Court recognized, Ms. Sebert has always had the ability to proceed with her career if she so chooses.Â We remain confident that when all the facts are presented that Ms. Sebertâs allegations against Luke will be shown to be completely false and were asserted solely to extort money and gain contractual leverage.â</p>","<p>Geragos did not respond to a request for comment following theÂ hearing.</p>","<p>In October 2014, Kesha suedÂ Dr. Luke, accusing him of drugging, raping and abusing her a decade ago; Dr. Luke has deniedÂ all charges. The producerâs lawyers argued that Kesha made up the allegations as an attempt to nullify her contract with Dr. Luke and Sony.Â Judge KornreichÂ reserved to rule on a motion to dismiss the claims until Kesha'sÂ lawyers filed more evidence on the alleged abuse.</p>","<p><b>Related</b></p>","<ul>\n <li><a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kesha-sues-producer-dr-luke-for-sexual-assault-and-battery-20141014?utm_source=yahoomusic&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoomusic&utm_medium=referral\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Kesha Sues Dr. Luke for Sexual Assault and Battery</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dr-luke-sues-kesha-for-defamation-breach-of-contract-after-sexual-assault-allegation-20141014?utm_source=yahoomusic&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoomusic&utm_medium=referral\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Dr. Luke Fires Back at Kesha With Defamation Suit</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dr-luke-sues-keshas-lawyer-for-defamation-after-gaga-rape-accusations-20141208?utm_source=yahoomusic&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoomusic&utm_medium=referral\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Dr. Luke Sues Keshaâs Lawyer for Gaga Sexual Assault Tweets</a></li> \n</ul>"]},"property":"music","cover_photo":{"img":null},"images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"9f81cd13-fdf2-3004-85a2-0515b716e982","licensed":"true","title":"Massachusetts plans rattlesnake colony on uninhabited island","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/massachusetts-plans-rattlesnake-colony-uninhabited-164619999.html","summary":"BOSTON (AP) â A plan by the state to establish a colony of venomous timber rattlesnakes on an off-limits island in Massachusetts&#39; largest body of water has some rattled by visions of dangerous serpents slithering through the surrounding woods, attacking hikers, fishermen and hunters.","entities":"WIKIID:Massachusetts|WIKIID:Rattlesnake|WIKIID:Quabbin_Reservoir|WIKIID:Mount_Zion","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000638|YCT:001000637","publisher":"Associated Press","author":"MARK PRATT","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/DuBQWBKPA4y5Oei3EAmwGA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://l.yimg.com/os/152/2012/04/21/image001-png_162613.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://www.ap.org/","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"84397933","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"84397933","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Massachusetts;Rattlesnake;Quabbin_Reservoir;Mount_Zion;Project\" ctopid=\"1996000;2051500;2056000\" hashtag=\"1996000;2051500;2056000\" rs=\"lmsid:a077000000IpoJiAAJ;revsp:ap.org;lpstaid:9f81cd13-fdf2-3004-85a2-0515b716e982\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"19 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo - ABC News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000638","score":"0.965957","label":"Environment"},{"term":"YCT:001000637","score":"0.908451","label":"Nature"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>BOSTON (AP) â A plan by the state to establish a colony of venomous timber rattlesnakes on an off-limits island in Massachusetts' largest body of water has some rattled by visions of dangerous serpents slithering through the surrounding woods, attacking hikers, fishermen and hunters.</p>","<p>Those are completely irrational fears based on the public's aversion to snakes, said Tom French of the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, who's directing the project at the 39-square mile Quabbin Reservoir and representing the state at a public meeting Tuesday to address the concerns.</p>","<p>French said he's received several emails and phone calls from worried residents who fear the snakes will escape the island.</p>","<p>\"People are afraid that we're going to put snakes in a place of public use and that they are going to breed like rabbits and spread over the countryside and kill everybody,\" he said.</p>","<p>There are only about 200 of the endangered snakes indigenous to Massachusetts left in five scattered pockets from greater Boston to the Berkshires, French said. Loss of habitat and human-caused deaths means they could disappear altogether, which is why the Quabbin project is so critical.</p>","<p>The plan to establish the snakes on Mount Zion â at more than 1,400 acres, the largest island in the reservoir â has been in the works for several years. A handful of snakes will be raised at Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island, and placed on the island in a couple more years when they are mature enough to survive in the wild.</p>","<p>The project has received the endorsement of Gov. Charlie Baker.</p>","<p>The public's concerns stem from the fact that rattlesnakes can swim and the island is connected to the mainland by a pair of narrow causeways, French said.</p>","<p>Bob Curley, an avid hiker, isn't opposed to the rattlesnake preservation effort; he just doesn't think the Quabbin is the place to do it. Even though Mount Zion of off limits to the public, he's concerned the state will use the snakes as an excuse to shut off public access to areas around the reservoir about 65 miles west of Boston.</p>","<p>\"When the inevitable happens and there is an interplay between a hiker and a rattler, what's the repercussion?\" said the Athol resident, who said his dog was bitten by a rattlesnake last summer. \"Are the trails around the Quabbin going to be shut down?\"</p>","<p>There is no plan to deny public access to the Quabbin, and concerns that snakes will leave the island and threaten humans are unfounded, French said.</p>","<p>Rattlesnakes are timid and only strike out when provoked. There have been no documented rattlesnake bite deaths in Massachusetts since colonial times, he said. He can't even recall an accidental bite in his 32 years with the state agency even though Massachusetts' rattlesnake populations live largely in public lands that get heavy foot traffic.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>On Mount Zion, the snakes will be safe from human interference, have ideal places to hibernate and plenty of mice and chipmunks to eat.</p>","<p>\"We want one place where the impact of people in not part of the equation,\" French said.</p>","<p>The state's message appears to be getting out.</p>","<p>Nancy Allen, chairwoman of the selectboard in Petersham, a town on the eastern shore of the reservoir, said she heard from fearful residents when the plan became public, but those fears died down once people educated themselves about the project.</p>","<p>\"Once they started to look into the facts, people started to change their minds,\" she said.</p>","<p>Peter Mallett, a recreational fisherman who lives in New Salem, a town on the Quabbin's western shore, opposed the snake project at first, but changed his mind after digging deeper.</p>","<p>\"People are just petrified of snakes,\" he said.</p>","<p>___</p>","<p>The public meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. Tuesday at Mahar Regional High School in Orange.</p>","<p>___</p>","<p>Online: Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife rattlesnake project, http://1.usa.gov/1RRfEKi</p>"]},"property":"news","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":326,"width":640,"ratio":51,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/4JNU9MLP8HVxO_cVge_FgA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0xO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/05e38c146d3e1609910f6a7067009976.jpg","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/v2iQLpo_mqJy1osqboHQbg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/05e38c146d3e1609910f6a7067009976.jpg","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[{"caption":"FILE-- In this Sept. 2008 handout file photograph from the Mass.

(AP) â Donald Trump's rivals are running out of time to stop him after his dominant performance in South Carolina.</p>","<p>A close look at the election calendar suggests that if the New York billionaire's rivals don't slow him by mid-March, their only chance to deny him the Republican presidential nomination may be a nasty and public fight at the party's convention this summer.</p>","<p>\"When you look at it right now, it looks like there's this juggernaut,\" said Rich Beeson, a senior aide to one of Trump's main rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.</p>","<p>The reason is delegates and how they're awarded.</p>","<p>Winning states generates headlines, but the nomination is earned by collecting a majority of the delegates awarded in primaries and caucuses. Next up: Nevada's caucuses on Tuesday.</p>","<p>This year, most contests award delegates proportionally, based on each candidate's share of the vote. Beeson and strategists for other campaigns argue that could make it hard for Trump to build a big lead because even the second- and third-place finisher can win delegates.</p>","<p>If one candidate can run up a significant lead, as Trump has begun to, then proportional contests also make it difficult for rivals to catch up.</p>","<p>South Carolina is the perfect example of this problem for Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The state isn't winner-take-all when it comes to delegates, but Trump's strength in all parts of South Carolina allowed him to haul in all 50 delegates awarded in Saturday's primary.</p>","<p>Trump now has 67 delegates. Cruz and Rubio took home none from South Carolina, leaving them with a total of 11 and 10, respectively.</p>","<p>Trump is well on his way, and he knows it.</p>","<p>\"Folks, let's go, let's have a big win in Nevada, let's have a big win in the SEC,\" Trump said in his South Carolina victory speech, referring to the states with universities in the Southeastern Conference that will vote next month. \"Let's put this thing away.\"</p>","<p>Only a small fraction of the delegates to be won in the GOP primary season, which began Feb. 1 in Iowa and ends June 7 in California and a handful of other states, have been awarded to date. But some of Trump's opponents acknowledge he could build an insurmountable lead by mid-March if current trends continue.</p>","<p>\"There are going to be a lot of circumstances where we can declare some victories and at least get this thing to March 15,\" Beeson said. \"Once we get to March 15, if the die has not been cast by then, it's a different game.\"</p>","<p>Why March 15?</p>","<p>That's the first day on which the GOP's rules allow states to hold a winner-take-all contest.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Florida will award 99 delegates that day, while Ohio will give out 66. The Missouri primary is that day, too.</p>","<p>Like South Carolina, Missouri awards a pot of delegates to the statewide winner, as well as three delegates each to the winner of each congressional district. That makes it possible for one candidate to win all of Missouri's 52 delegates, or at least a large majority.</p>","<p>Put simply, it's a day in which a candidate running second to Trump could catch up. Or fall even further behind.</p>","<p>Altogether, there are 14 such contests on the GOP primary calendar, offering a total of 752 delegates. That's not enough delegates to claim the nomination; it takes 1,237. But if one candidate wins most of those states, he could build a lead too big to overcome.</p>","<p>In the modern political era, a candidate usually wins enough delegates to emerge as the presumptive nominee several weeks â or even months â before the end of primary voting. That happens when the candidate claims so many delegates it's all but impossible for anyone else to catch up.</p>","<p>But the nomination isn't formalized until the party's presidential nominating convention, scheduled for July this year. The last time the Republican nomination wasn't decided before the convention was 1976. Yet some of Trump's rivals are already talking about the possibility of a \"contested\" convention as they envision a series of second- or third-place finishes in the upcoming GOP primaries.</p>","<p>Rubio's campaign manager, Terry Sullivan, recently told The Associated Press, \"I would be surprised if it's not May or the convention\" when the party settles on its nominee.</p>","<p>At the convention, a lead in the race for delegates guarantees nothing if the candidate doesn't have an outright majority, said Ben Ginsberg, a leading Republican election attorney. Under most state party rules, delegates are only required to vote for their candidate on the first ballot at the convention.</p>","<p>\"If no one comes into the convention with a majority of delegates, then all bets are off,\" Ginsberg said. \"You're dealing with a potentially unruly and independent group of people.\"</p>","<p>___</p>","<p>Ohlemacher reported from Washington.

From the creative chaos of her home studio in London, Barrow creates clever DIY staples that are marked out by a painterly aesthetic she calls âneoprimitive.â Wearing mannish trousers of her own design and a T-shirt that reads âsame same but differentâ â a statement confirmed by a punkish Louise Brooks bob â Barrow cuts a lean figure. Her dark eyes flash beneath gold vintage glasses as she clears a place to sit on the leopard-print sofa amidst the buzzing melee while her boyfriend plays eerie ambient sounds behind the decks. Though itâs just two days before her London Fashion Week presentation, which she showed Sunday, Barrow is preternaturally calm. âWeâve already shot the look books and made a series of films, so weâre all set,â she says, playing with the âBad Womanâ badge thatâs pinned to her chest. âItâs nice and relaxed, but it feels a bit weird.â For Fall 2016, Barrow blurs the boundaries between art and fashion still further, with an exhibition-style outing at Londonâs Institute of Contemporary Arts titled âThe Retro-Spective.â Alongside the eclectic clothes, Barrow will display a series of short films and artworks that survey her own archive. âThis collection is all about history,â she says of her retroactive theme. âAs a society, we are constantly referencing and looking back at different eras.

I want to ask the question: What is new anymore?â The answer begins presumably with the giant gowns that are currently hanging from a makeshift rail on the other side of the studio. These vast couture confections are crudely stitched from sections of canvas once the size of theater sets, and decorated with a menagerie of phantasmagoric figures from throughout time. These enchanting gowns are destined to go on display at M.Goldstein , the Hackney gallery where Barrow is represented as an artist and where this spring she will open a solo of her works on canvas. &nbsp; This season, the enterprising 25-year-old designer has also produced a 10-piece collection of fine knitwear sweaters and dresses created in collaboration with the British brand John Smedley . âItâs a nice way of getting the artwork into more wearable pieces,â concedes Barrow as she wraps her frame in an oversize jacquard shawl inscribed with something akin to Greek and Roman figures. There are evening-length gloves and leg warmers too, with collegiate doodles like âI Love 2016â and âMiniskirts Forever.â Barrow has even carved a clay bustier, complete with protruding nipples, though its real-world functionality is still up in the air. âItâs fantastical and theatrical,â says Barrow of the divergent collection, which also features gauzy froufrou skirts, prairie dresses, and a silk kimono whose na&iuml;ve brushstrokes recall Picassoâs ceramics. âThe important thing to remember is that itâs not historically accurate,â she deadpans in her Middlesbrough patter. âItâs all in my head.â Follow us on Facebook , Instagram , and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.","hosted":true,"publicationDate":"1 hour 32 minutes ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000031","score":"0.950311","label":"Arts & Entertainment"},{"term":"YCT:001000073","score":"0.853659","label":"Fashion"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p><i>All photography by: <a href=\"http://www.jamiestoker.com/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Jamie Stoker</a></i></p>","<p>Clothes are akin to a canvas for British designer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/19/t-magazine/british-female-designers-london-fashion-week.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Claire Barrow</a>.

Thereâs no big delegate bounty yet; in Nevada, as in Iowa, the math delivers her only a slight edge, with plenty of contests to come that can shift the balance. </p>","<br>","<a href=\"http://abcn.ws/1oBBUfT \" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Hillary Clinton Projected to Win Nevada Caucuses</a>","<br>","<br>","<a href=\"http://abcn.ws/1oAGET7\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Live Nevada Democratic Caucus Entrance Poll Analysis</a>","<br>","<p> Critically, Sanders showed in Nevada that his campaign can reach a different swath of voters. Sanders carried Latino voters by eight percentage points, even though Clinton won two-thirds of Hispanics in the same state eight years ago. Though Sanders lost African-Americans by a 3-1 margin, heâs at least shown that he can win voters who arenât white. </p>","<p> Sanders again trounced Clinton among younger voters. Three-fourths of caucus-goers under age 45 supported Sanders on Saturday, and he won nearly 85 percent of those under 30. </p>","<p> Despite the loss, Sanders has a clear claim on the hearts of Democrats. For voters wanting a candidate who âcares about people like me,â eight in 10 chose Sanders. Among those wanting a candidate who is âhonest and trustworthy,â Sanders got 85 percent. </p>","<p> Clinton retains a hold on the partyâs heads. For voters who value electability in November, more than three-fourths favored Clinton in Nevada. For those wanting the âright experience,â the margin was even more lopsided â north of 90 percent. </p>","<p> Clinton backers have made much of her âfirewallâ â the cache of states that vote between next weekend and early March that have large numbers of black and working-class white voters. Thatâs the Clinton base, and sheâs better positioned coming out of Nevada to start a winning streak that will quiet the loudest of critics. </p>","<p> Sanders will need to win some states heâs not expected to if heâs going to contend for the nomination. </p>","<p> That didnât happen in Nevada.

She did wellÂ among Latinos and also among African-American voters in North Las Vegas, a good sign for her heading into South Carolina. And she performed well among rank-and-file union members, including those who packed casino caucus sites, a good sign for her looking ahead to Rust Belt states.</p><p>Sanders is \"not going to have the luxury moving forward of having weeks and weeks to organize,\" Damore said. \"That passion and activism gets blunted in primaries with much larger turnouts. Itâs just much more difficult for him moving forward, with the calendar.\"</p><p>Sanders, in an e-mail to supporters seeking $3 contributions after conceding the state to Clinton, wrote that there remains \"a path to victory for our political revolution\" and that he is \"closing the gap dramatically in states that have yet to vote.\"</p><p>\"Nevada was supposed to be a state 'tailor made' for the Clinton campaign, and a place she once led by almost 40 points,\" the e-mail said. He said the closeness of his loss had \"sent a message that will stun the political and financial establishment of this country: our campaign can win anywhere.\"</p><p>Mary Kay Henry, international president of the Service Employees International Union, whichÂ endorsed Clinton, said in statement that members would rally in the March contests âas a massive ground force to share one very clear message: when Hillary Clinton wins, we all win.â</p><p>Bob Stein, a Rice University political scientist, said Clinton hasnât yet completely righted the ship but can at least deliver a reset message of, âWait âtil I get to South Carolina.â</p><p>âShe buys herself time,â Stein said, while now Sanders âhas to go back to the Democratic base and convince them he has credible answers to things they care about.â</p><p>âBut she still has a problem,â Stein said. âItâs not Bernie thatâs the problem; sheâs the problem whether she wins by 10 or five or sixâ points. âPeople donât like her, they donât trust her and itâs a generational shift. And she has to convince people she cares about them and understands them.â</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid stayed neutral through the caucuses --Â but may have helped Clinton through his advocacy for unionized casino workers, a heavily Latino population, to get paid time off to caucus at six on-site casino caucus locations.</p><p>In a memo released the night of the New Hampshire primary, Mook, Clintonâs campaign manager, wrote that looking ahead to the next two contests, in Nevada and South Carolina, âweâve built first-rate organizations in each state and we feel very good about our prospects for success.â</p><p>Clintonâs support in Hispanic as well as African-American communities is âwell known,â Mook wrote.</p><p>Already by then, however, Clintonâs team saw signs Sanders could run more competitively in Nevada than theyâd hoped. Mook underscored in that memo that he believed âthe nomination will very likely be won in March, not Februaryâ and that it would be in March that Clinton could build a âpotentially insurmountableâ delegate lead in the later contests.</p><p>Updates starting in seventh paragraph with Clinton and Sanders comments.</p><p>More from Bloomberg.com</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-02-20/u-s-high-court-rejects-republicans-on-north-carolina-voting-map?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Republicans on North Carolina Voting Map</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-02-20/clinton-pulls-out-narrow-nevada-win-after-late-surge-by-sanders?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Clinton Pulls Out Nevada Victory After Late Sanders Surge</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-02-20/scalia-mourned-as-late-u-s-justice-s-funeral-draws-thousands?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Scalia Mourned as Late U.S. Justice's Funeral Draws Crowds</a></li>\n </ul><p>Read <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-02-20/clinton-s-nevada-win-shifts-burden-back-to-sanders-to-stop-her?cmpid=yhoo.headline\" rel=\"canonical\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Clintonâs Nevada Win Shifts Burden Back to Sanders to Stop Her</a> on bloombergpolitics.com</p> </p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"4e50b490-6448-3f37-9054-547680ff42f0","licensed":"true","title":"Champions League: Iniesta wary of &#39;unpredictable&#39; Sanchez","link":"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/iniesta-wary-unpredictable-sanchez-093300045.html","summary":"Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta has identified Alexis Sanchez as Arsenal&#39;s dangerman ahead of their Champions League tie.","entities":"WIKIID:Andr%c3%a9s_Iniesta|WIKIID:Alexis_S%c3%a1nchez|WIKIID:Arsenal_F.C.|WIKIID:UEFA_Champions_League","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000001|YCT:001000028","publisher":"Omnisport","author":"","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/2BlMxZLcQm8O7Vy9QbgyKw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2015-09-22/64149bd0-6123-11e5-9161-69627ce290f7_omnisport_logo.png.cf.jpg","site":"sports","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"2716772","propertyRegion":"YPROP:sports","enable_lead":true,"ad_meta":{"spaceid":"2716772","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Andr%c3%a9s_Iniesta;Alexis_S%c3%a1nchez;Arsenal_F.C.;UEFA_Champions_League;Luis_Enrique_%28footballer%29;Barcelona\" ctopid=\"2074500;2078500;2112500;2212000;2298000\" hashtag=\"2074500;2078500;2112500;2212000;2298000\" rs=\"lmsid:a0ad000000AxDnbAAF;revsp:omnisport.uk;lpstaid:4e50b490-6448-3f37-9054-547680ff42f0\"","site":"sports","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"8 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo Sports - NBC Sports Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000001","score":"0.998532","label":"Sports & Recreation"},{"term":"YCT:001000028","score":"0.957895","label":"Soccer"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>Andres Iniesta has described Arsenal as \"dangerous\" and former team-mate Alexis Sanchez as \"unpredictable\" ahead of Barcelona's trip to the Emirates StadiumÂ on Tuesday.</p>","<p>Barca go into the Champions League round-of-16 tie as overwhelming favourites to see off the Gunners onceÂ again - they knocked them out of Europe's elite club competition in 2010 and 2011 as well as beating them in the 2006 final.</p>","<p>Arsenal's main threat is likely to come fromÂ Chile international Sanchez, who played alongside IniestaÂ at Camp Nou between 2011 and 2014.</p>","<p>\"What makesÂ AlexisÂ so dangerous is that he is unpredictable,\" the Spaniard told Arsenal's official website. \"When he dribbles, when he attacks, he is a very strong player.</p>","<p>\"Heâs got skill and when he has the ball he always creates doubts.
