The criticsâ favorite, <i>Spotlight</i><i>,</i> seemed destined to win early on but has never really proven its status as frontrunner in the awards race, winning top-tier awards only from the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild. <i>The Big Short</i> could have a big chance, given its surprise win at the Producers Guild Awards, which have correctly predicted the Oscarsâ Best Picture for the past eight years (a stat only slightly marred by a 2013 tie at the PGAs between <i>12 Years a Slave</i> and <i>Gravity</i>), but it still doesnât quite <i>feel</i> like the type of film the Academy fully invests in.</p>","<p>And then thereâs <i>The Revenant</i>, which opened awards season with a bang at the Golden Globes, claimed the most Oscar nominations â 12 â and added exclamation points recently with big wins from the Directors Guild and BAFTAs. Plus, itâs been a beast at the box office, grossing over $165 million so far.</p>","<p>Iâve made the mistake of stubbornly holding out for early favorites in years past (<i>The Social Network</i>, <i>Boyhood</i>), but the Academy continues to prove that when itâs a close race, itâs all about momentum.

But itâs been all Brie these last couple months, as the 26-year-old has taken the SAG Award, the Globe, the BAFTA, and more. Next comes the Oscar.

The man who also smashes it as Hulk gives the best performance in an ensemble packed with great ones as the loose cannon in the bunch of intrepid <i>Boston Globe</i> reporters taking on the Catholic Church.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont, in the stateâs Democratic presidential primary. African-Americans typically make up the majority of South Carolinaâs Democratic electorate and, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/sc/Dem\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">according to CNNâs exit polling</a>, Clinton won with the support of 84 percent of the stateâs black community.</p>","<p>Her husband,Â <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/10/05/comment-6543\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Bill Clinton, was famously dubbed Americaâs âfirst black presidentâ</a> because of his background, behavior and the admiration he earned from some in the African-American community during his time in office. But fond memories of Bill and the 1990s arenât what cemented Hillary Clintonâs edge with black voters in South Carolina. Clinton managed to build a base in the Palmetto State through a years-long, under-the-radar operation to stay in touch and gather support from African-American leaders in the state she lost to Barack Obama in 2008.</p>","<p>Sanders, on the other hand, struggled to gain traction with black voters in South Carolina, hampered by the very thing that has lifted him elsewhere: his position as an outsider and newcomer on the stateâs political scene. Attempts at outreach came late and were described by some local African-American leaders as ham-fisted. </p>","<p>The Clinton campaignâs South Carolina ground operation launched on the day she announced her presidential bid last April. At the time, she was the clear frontrunner and had the fundraising to match. That early edge let Clinton hire experienced local staff and set up shop in South Carolina, long before Sanders was seen as anything more than a long-shot challenger with little national profile. </p>","<p>âWe were in this state first. The day we launched this campaign, we had staff in the state,â said Marlon Marshall, Clintonâs director of states and political engagement. </p>","<p>But Clintonâs presence in South Carolina began long before that day. Bill Clinton won the Palmetto State primaries in 1992 and 1996, which allowed Hillary Clinton to build relationships in the state and get to know its politics and leading personages. In fact, Clintonâs ties in the state predate her husbandâs presidential bid. Clay Middleton, a native South Carolinian who served as state director of Clintonâs campaign, noted she first came into the state during the 1970s, while working as a young lawyer with the Childrenâs Defense Fund. And as first lady of Arkansas, Clinton co-chaired a task force on infant mortality with former South Carolina Gov. Richard Riley.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p><b><i><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/clinton-wins-big-south-carolina-021136921.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Slideshow: Clinton wins big in South Carolina >>></a></i></b><br /></p>","<p>âSheâs been working in and with South Carolinians since the â70s, but every decade since then, sheâs been in and out of the state working with people,â Middleton said. âShe has deep roots here, and it has blossomed over the years.â </p>","<p>But all that support seemingly vanished in 2008, when Clinton faced off against Obama, the first African-American major-party presidential primary frontrunner. Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the NAACP, attributed Clintonâs loss that year to the simple fact that voters had â and wanted to take â the chance to elect the first black president. </p>","<p>âBefore that possibility came, Hillary was actually doing quite well,â Darby explained. âShe had nailed down a good number of endorsements.â</p>","<p>Nevertheless, even after being beaten by Obama in South Carolina, Clinton never retreated from South Carolina, Darby said. </p>","<p>âI donât think Hillaryâs ever been off the ground except for the little while when there was a tiff after the â08 primary. She has stayed in touch with the community. She started laying groundwork for this run, oh, probably three or four years ago. Sheâs had people circulating. â¦ Sheâs talked to the right folks,â Darby said, adding, âI donât think South Carolina ever entirely left the Clintons. It might have parked them in the corner for one election, but theyâve maintained good relationships.â </p>","<p>In contrast, a source said the Sanders campaign did not begin to establish a large presence in the state until last September.</p>","<figure width=\"5184\" height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/AMJdPu21MpK9SK4mlKnTSQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/bfb5858d1b89a3ec82a8b97016c69747/tumblr_inline_o384tizJQd1tedrp5_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"426.6666666666667\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Hillary Clinton in a group prayer led by the Rev.

Margie Bright Matthews.

The rapper Killer Mike, whose music mixes political messages and hard-driving hip-hop beats, campaigned for Sanders in the state and sought to draw the support of a younger African-American audience. Killer Mike made the case that Sandersâ message echoes that of Martin Luther King Jr. â even if the âidolsâ of Kingâs movement are with Clinton. </p>","<p>âFor me, the policy that Dr. King was about at the time of his death, the Poor Peopleâs Campaign, workersâ rights, civil and social justice for all people, are best accomplished with the Sanders campaign,â Killer Mike said. âIf you take the idols themselves out of the equation and only leave the policies and principles that they taught for the last 50 years, Iâd not see how any rational black person could vote for anyone but Bernie Sanders.â</p>","<p>But in South Carolina, many black voters clearly resisted Sandersâ âpolitical revolution.â While Sandersâ promise to take on the political establishment has helped fuel his challenge to Clinton in other parts of the country, that outsider status may have actually hurt him in South Carolinaâs African-American community. </p>","<p>JA Moore is a 30-year-old African-American South Carolina native who serves as vice chair of the Charleston County Democratic Party. As of Wednesday, Moore said he had not decided how he will vote in the primary. But in Charleston, where he moved a little over a decade ago, Moore says he is still viewed as an outsider. </p>","<p>âMe not being from Charleston, they call me a âcome ya,â and people that are from here, they call them a âbeen ya,ââ Moore said, using phrases from the local Geechee dialect. âI think a lot of times people look at Secretary Clinton as someone thatâs been here before. Theyâve seen her, they recognize her, they have a certain level of comfort with her because they know her. â¦ I think with Sen. Sanders, heâs a âcome ya.ââ </p>","<p>Addressing recent racial wounds in the state, only some of which have made national news, has been a tricky thing for insider and outsider candidate alike. In April of last year, a black man named Walter Scott was shot in the back and killed as he ran from a white police officer in North Charleston. Footage of the shooting energized the Black Lives Matter movement in South Carolina. Then, two months later, white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine people at âMother Emanuel,â a historic African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston.</p>","<p>These incidents have had a âtransformativeâ effect on South Carolinaâs political landscape, said Moore, whose sister was killed in the church shooting.</p>","<p>âWeâre going to be forever affected by Emanuel and forever affected by the tragedy of Walter Scott as well,â Moore said, adding: âFriends of mine have called me throughout the country and said, âJA, why arenât people here in Charleston, why arenât they doing what happened in Baltimore or in Ferguson? Why arenât people looting the streets and burning things down? Why does it seem to be the African-American community is so subdued in Charleston?ââ </p>","<p>Moore said thereâs no question Charlestonâs black population is upset. </p>","<p>âWeâre angry. Weâre frustrated. Weâre devastated because of this tragedy,â Moore said. âI want to make sure thatâs clear. Weâre angry, but â¦ weâre looking for substantive change and substantive actions to happen because of it.â </p>","<p>Along with the issues of racism and police brutality that have made headlines, local African-American leaders who spoke with Yahoo News listed a slew of things the community in South Carolina is concerned about: poor quality of schools, rural communities that lack access to clean drinking water, poverty and high incarceration rates. </p>","<p>Clinton and Sanders had to navigate this fraught landscape as they sought to win the stateâs black vote. And both of them have stumbled as they tried to connect with a community where the list of grievances is long and emotions are running high. </p>","<p>Heading into the South Carolina primary, the two Democratic candidates both made targeted pitches designed to address the specific concerns of African-American voters. </p>","<p>In recent weeks, Clinton has begun discussing the need to comprehensively address âsystemic racismâ by toppling economic and institutional âbarriers.â Clinton has also campaigned with African-American mothers who lost their children to incidents of alleged police brutality and racial profiling and has promised to take on these issues. Her campaign has said some of the new elements of Clintonâs platform <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/the-powerful-eight-month-journey-that-helped-125603248.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">came after months of conversations</a> with these so-called âMothers of the Movement.â </p>","<figure width=\"4000\" height=\"2666\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/EjkGPaweU61X98hBjWCGXw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/99e107d05171c0b22f53cca152caf99f/tumblr_inline_o384seLYDp1tedrp5_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"426.56\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Clinton appears at a campaign event at the Central Baptist Church in Columbia, S.C., on Tuesday with mothers of victims of gun violence.

(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/AP)</i></p>","<p>Bakari Sellers, a Democratic former member of the state Legislature who mounted an unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign in 2014, noted that Clinton âdidnât haveâ these messages as part of her platform in 2008. Sellers, who is a Clinton supporter, praised her for turning to black women as she crafted her outreach to the community and predicted it would help her win the primary.</p>","<p>âOne of the problems [in 2008] was that she didnât go to where â¦ her heart aligned and â¦ the heart of the African-American community, which are African-American women,â Sellers said. âAfrican-American women â¦ participate at higher rates, they register at higher rates, and they drive the political discourse in our community now. And Hillary Clinton [is reaching out to these women now], and that is why sheâs going to be very successful on Saturday.â</p>","<p>Despite Clintonâs tailored pitch, she did not manage to win over all of South Carolinaâs African-American activist community. On Wednesday evening, local Black Lives Matter activists bought $500 tickets to a campaign fundraiser <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/hillary-clinton-just-responded-black-215400367.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">in order to confront Clinton</a> about a comment she made during the 1996 presidential primary describing some juvenile criminals as âsuper predatorsâ who needed to be brought âto heel.â Ashley Williams, the activist who took the stage at the fundraiser, was removed by Secret Service, but Clinton subsequently apologized for her remark and said she âshouldnât have used those wordsâ and âwouldnât use them today.â</p>","<p>The protest was an extension of continuing criticism Clinton has faced for her role in pushing for her husbandâs 1994 crime bill that many activists see as a major contributor to high incarceration rates in the black community. Clinton has disavowed much of that crime law. </p>","<p>Sellers said it was good to see activists hold Clinton âaccountable.â However, he also noted Sanders voted for the crime law as a member of the House of Representatives and expressed hope that Black Lives Matter allies would raise the issue. </p>","<p>âIâm sure they will take that to Bernie Sanders as well and question him on why,â Sellers said. </p>","<p>Like Clinton, Sanders has tried to specifically address the needs of African-American voters in his platform. Sanders has increasingly highlighted criminal justice reform and police brutality in his speeches. </p>","<p>âHeâs â¦ saying that the policy of fair pay affects black people, the policy of ending the drug war affects black people, the policy of ending mandatory minimums on our federal sentencing guidelines affects black people,â said Killer Mike.Â </p>","<p>The rapper also praised how Sanders reacted when he was <a href=\"http://time.com/3989917/black-lives-matter-protest-bernie-sanders-seattle/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters</a> last August, by comparison with Clintonâs handling of the protest on Wednesday.</p>","<p>âWhen Black Lives Matter took the stage with Sen. Sanders, he shook their hands, he smiled, he stepped to the side, he listened,â he said. Clinton, instead âhad the Secret Service escort that young woman out.â </p>","<p>Sanders and his campaign also highlighted his youthful activism in the civil rights movement. Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-personally-confirms-photo-213900077.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">pictures were unearthed</a> showing Sanders being arrested at a 1963 civil rights protest in Chicago. </p>","<p>But Sandersâ past activism wasnât enough to win voters in South Carolina, said Sellers, whose father, Cleveland Sellers, helped lead the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. </p>","<p>âYour talking point to the black community canât be, you know, âI marched with Dr. King.â â¦ Thatâs cool. My dad made cheese sandwiches at the March on Washington. What else? Tell me more,â Sellers said. âLike, you have a picture of getting arrested. I thank you so much for your efforts in Chicago, but I mean, all Iâve got to do is go down the street to find a civil rights hero in South Carolina.â</p>","<p>Sanders has also faced criticism for his relentless focus on income inequality and regulating Wall Street, which some charge neglects the effects of racism on creating inequality.</p>","<p>Minister Kirsten John Foy, the northeast regional director at the National Action Network, said this is partly why some of the activists who attended Rev. Al Sharptonâs breakfast with Sanders in New York on Feb. 10 were only partially impressed.</p>","<p>âThe economic piece of it is great. We love it. We think itâs right on the money,â Foy said of Sandersâ message.</p>","<p>However, when it came to racial issues, Foy said Sanders lacked specifics. He also claimed some of the NAN leadership felt Sanders was insufficiently pro-gun control, a criticism leveled by the Clinton campaign. </p>","<p>âI think he has gone out of his way to show that heâs sensitive to our political needs, and that was what I think was impressive about the meeting. But thereâs still like gaps in his connectivity,â Foy said.</p>","<p>While Foy said while some of the NAN leadership backs Sanders, he and others support Clinton. Because the group is divided, Sharpton has elected to remain neutral and refrain from endorsing in the Democratic primary.</p>","<p>âHeâs willing to say all the right things like, âIâm going to end institutional racism.â But how do you do that? You donât just do that with an economic message,â Foy said of Sanders. âYou have to speak to the various disparities and what youâre going to do about them. And I think Hillary has a better handle on that piece.â</p>","<p>In addition to problems with his message, in South Carolina, the Sanders campaign seems to have had issues with the delivery of that message. </p>","<p>A source told Yahoo News that an influential member of the state Legislature received several direct appeals from Clinton asking for an endorsement. They were taken aback when the Sanders campaign reached out and the call came from the senatorâs wife rather than Sanders himself. </p>","<p>Darby, the vice president of the NAACPâs Charleston branch, said heâs seen a âclumsinessâ in Sandersâ âapproach to the leadershipâ in South Carolinaâs black community. </p>","<p>âLet me put this very carefully,â Darby began, âSometimes my good and well-meaning liberal brothers and sisters get the feeling that they know whatâs good for black folk. â¦ They donât try to reach out. They donât try to check in and affirm, âDo you really think that this is good for you too? What do you think of our plans? â¦ Iâve picked up little whiffs of that in the Sanders campaign, and I donât think itâs served them well. â¦ You have to meet people on their terms.â</p>","<p>Darby said the only contacts he received from the Sanders campaign came from people who were âwhiteâ and âout of state.â</p>","<p>âNobody really local reached out to me. These were folks that were brought â¦ into South Carolina from the campaign. â¦ This was not African-American outreach. This was white outreach,â Darby said.</p>","<figure width=\"5232\" height=\"3488\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/p72sFgIf_OK0JFN3jFmmOA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/8340eb075ec539d192ed1addd512a491/tumblr_inline_o384q0avlh1tedrp5_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"426.6666666666667\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Clinton greets supporters after a town hall meeting on Thursday at Cumberland United Methodist Church in Florence, S.C. (Photo: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)</i>Â Â </p>","<p>Dot Scott, the president of the NAACPâs Charleston branch, was similarly critical of Sandersâ team. Scott, who admitted being family friends with Clintonâs South Carolina state director, said she only had one contact with the Sanders campaign, and it went âsour.â </p>","<p>Like many South Carolinians, Scott has received calls at home from phone bankers. She said one of these entreaties from the Sanders campaign led her to go off on a 10-minute tirade and demand an apology. </p>","<p>âOne of my experiences that I think I wonât forget for a long time is a call that I got from the Sanders campaign. This person that called asked me was I voting for Sen. Sanders. I said no. I was voting for Secretary Clinton. The phone went silent for a little bit,â Scott recounted. âYou could hear this person struggling to come up with what theyâre going to say next. â¦ They call that a real pregnant pause, nine monthsâ worth of pregnant pause. And he finally came back and he says to me, âYou know, Senator Sanders is for welfare.ââ</p>","<p>This did not provoke a positive reaction from Scott.</p>","<p>âI lost it. So youâre going to assume either from my voice or from my selection that the most important thing that Sen. Sanders is going to be working on that would interest me is more welfare?â Scott said. âI went on to read him the riot act. Listen, Iâm not only a college graduate; Iâve got a masters. My daughter is a college graduate. I have never had one ounce of welfare before. I ainât never lived in public housing. None of those things.â</p>","<p>According to Scott, the Sanders supporter who called her âdidnât know what to say.â</p>","<p>âBy the time he hung up, it was ten minutes later,â she said. âI got one of the managers to call me back and apologize.â</p>","<p>Scott made it clear she does not believe that is something âSanders would tell them to sayâ and added that the call probably came from a volunteer or low-ranking staffer. Still, she said it is the only contact she has had with the Sanders campaign, while Clintonâs team has made much more substantive outreach. </p>","<p>The NAACP is a nonpartisan organization, so Scott said she does not attend political events and did not want to make any public endorsement. Still, Scott claimed she regularly received personal invitations to Clinton campaign events and has not had âone iotaâ of similar contact from Sanders.</p>","<p>âI have gotten every invitation from someone when Clinton has been here,â Scott said. âIâm on that invite list. The Sanders folks, no.â</p>","<p>Sandersâ insurgency in the earlier primary states has been fueled by the support of young voters. Both Killer Mike and Ben Jealous, the former NAACP president and CEO who is now also a Sanders campaign surrogate, said they believed Sandersâ message was resonating better with young black voters than with their elders.</p>","<p>âWhen you look at black people under 30, you see them turning to Bernie disproportionately across the country,â Jealous said. </p>","<p>âAt the end of the day, the Clintons are a lot like Coca-Cola. Theyâre a Southern brand. We all know they taste good, but itâs worth asking yourself: Is that brand really good for you? â¦ Fighting a powerful brand that happens to be the most powerful dynasty in American politics is always an uphill battle,â he said. </p>","<p>A recent NBC News poll showed Clinton was <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/south-carolina-poll-younger-blacks-lean-toward-clinton-not-sanders-n521091\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">actually doing better than Sanders</a> among South Carolinaâs younger black population. </p>","<p>For his part, Killer Mike said he understands why older blacks have gravitated toward Clinton. But he canât comprehend why the youth arenât getting on board with Sanders. </p>","<p> âIf we canât win our grandmothers over, thatâs fine, because their leaders and their icons have told them to go another way,â Killer Mike explained. âBut if youâre young, if youâre sensible, if youâre an African-American, thatâs currently in the fight for freedom, justice and liberation, I donât understand why his policies will not connect.â</p>","<p>Darby, the Charleston NAACP leader, suggested Sandersâ message could have reached black voters in South Carolina if he had had more time. However, at this point, he argued Clintonâs experience and operation in the state were simply too strong to compete with. </p>","<p>âI think Bernie Sanders has done a good job of trying to come up to speed, and I think given a little bit more time, he might actually get there,â Darby explained. âBut the Clintons have the time and the longevity. â¦ Sheâs a known quantity. â¦ She knows how to do the retail politics of South Carolina. She knows how to do the retail politics of the black church, and so sheâs presented herself well.â </p>"]},"property":"politics","images":[{"caption":"How Hillary Clinton won the battle for the black vote in South Carolina","id":"90ca0d47-9236-3ea6-82d4-68045705bc5d","title":"How Hillary Clinton won the battle for the black vote in South Carolina","type":"photo","shortCaption":"How Hillary Clinton won the battle for the black vote in South Carolina","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/RTIYg45JoPenTq28WhfHcg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/8fb27dc3fb7e09c7bfbba5b92a1efdb2","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"How Hillary Clinton won the battle for the black vote in South Carolina","id":"c2611a6c-e5d3-34ae-8dab-7ac5a714e74e","title":"How Hillary Clinton won the battle for the black vote in South Carolina","type":"photo","shortCaption":"How Hillary Clinton won the battle for the black vote in South Carolina","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/V4vOQG0CaKnUtj9wVepEcw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ebb97f684ceac5d2f5c3e78253c24ed1","alt":null},"index":2},{"caption":"How Hillary Clinton won the battle for the black vote in South Carolina","id":"d1bdadce-aec2-3f1a-ab11-df39858b6bab","title":"How Hillary Clinton won the battle for the black vote in South Carolina","type":"photo","shortCaption":"How Hillary Clinton won the battle for the black vote in South Carolina","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/4rC79A_zKgR1BIL6lhNsCw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/bf27446d80362d167fd62ca2db5cbe06","alt":null},"index":3},{"caption":"Democratic voters cast their ballots in the South Carolina primary where Hillary Clinton is seeking a big win, fueled by her outsized support among the state&#39;s African-American voters.

A source from a fourth team said the franchise's doctors were asked to hold their assessment entirely until after Smith's recheck. The consensus among the teams setting Smith aside is that a conservative approach will likely require a \"redshirt year\" in 2016.</p>","<p>Two teams said that even if Smith's April recheck is satisfactory, he will still likely land on their \"sub board\" â a list containing red-flagged players who will be considered if they fall to a certain point in the draft.Â </p>","<p>Much like those teams, Smith's draft position is likely up in the air for arguably every NFL franchise until April. That's a fairly significant reality exiting the scouting combine, particularly for a player who many identified as one of the special players in the draft.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Smith inadvertently prompted the question of potential nerve damage after he tweeted a video of himself walking without a knee brace earlier this week. The video caught the eye of former San Diego Chargers team doctor David Chao, who pointed out on his own Twitter account that Smith was wearing a brace on his lower leg and ankle used to help with nerve recovery. When Smith arrived for his media session at the combine Friday, the exchange quickly turned to questions of potential nerve damage.</p>","<span class=\"yui-tweet yui-editorial-embed\">\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n  <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Amazing walking without the knee brace six days after being restricted for six weeks and feels fantastic! <a href=\"https://t.co/dAW8OW09Ke\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">pic.twitter.com/dAW8OW09Ke</a></p>â Jaylon Smith (@thejaylonsmith) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thejaylonsmith/status/702584594550398976\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">February 24, 2016</a>\n </blockquote></span>","<p>Initially, Smith said the nerve wasn't damaged and hadn't been \"stretched.\" But as the session went on, he characterized the nerve as \"healing.\"</p>","<p>\"It's just a matter of the recovery process,\" Smith said. \"I don't know when the nerves and everything will heal. It's just a matter of me taking it day by day and controlling what I can control.\"</p>","<p>Asked specifically about the lower leg brace in the video, which also appeared to cover his ankle, Smith said it was indeed to address a nerve issue.</p>","<p>\"The AFO [ankle foot orthosis] is to help me walk and to help everything heal,\" he said. \"It's helping the nerve heal.\"</p>","<p>Smith weighed 223 pounds at the combine, 20 pounds below the 243 he played at during the college football season. In September, Smith said he wanted to maintain his weight at 243 for the remainder of his football career. If that's still the case, his rehabilitation process will include not only recovering his ability to cut, run and explode on his knee, but also regaining any lost strength and good weight.</p>","<p>This is why teams will obsess over his medical report from this week, and how significantly it improves by the April recheck. Unlike UCLA's Myles Jack, who had his knee aggressively manipulated on Friday, Smith mostly did some walking for doctors to show his progress since surgery on Jan. 7.</p>","<p>\"There's a lot of segments of the combine that all these players are going to go through, and for somebody like Jaylon, when he goes and visits with the medical staff and team doctors, that's going to be his most important visit,\" Los Angeles Rams general manager Les Snead said. \"What you find, with him, is where his knee is, and what the long-term prognosis is will [determine] where he gets drafted, and if you want to call it, 'Is the risk worth the reward?'\"</p>","<p>\"You may figure out with him he may not play any his rookie year,\" Snead said. \"But if you think he's a top-five talent and he's going to get to that level â Year 2, Year 3, Year 4 â yes it takes courage but it could turn out to be a wise decision. Like I'd tell Jaylon, whether you got hurt or not, it really doesn't matter where you get drafted. It matters, whether we're talking about Jaylon or any other player who has been injured in four, five, six, seven, eight to 10 years.\"</p>","<p>For his part, Smith remained adamant that he expects to recover fully and be an impact player in the pros, potentially a defensive version of Rams running back Todd Gurley, who as the 10th overall pick last season overcame his own significant knee issue to arrive as one of the NFL's brightest young stars in 2015. That level of recovery would suit prospective teams just fine, as they typically salivate over players with Smith's level of skills, smarts, athleticism and versatility. It's universally believed that Smith could be a high-level player at inside or outside linebacker, while serving as an every-down player who could be a fit in almost any defensive scheme or package.</p>","<p>\"It's a long=term decision, whoever drafts me,\" Smith said. \"I'm a guy who will be around for a while, playing at an elite level. An impact player. It was great watching a guy like Todd Gurley do it last year. â¦ I'm going to be a very impactful player for a long time.\"</p>","<p>Before he can get to that \"long time\" goal, Smith must first get to April. That's when many across the league will find out exactly how much confidence NFL teams have recovered in their assessment of the Notre Dame star.</p>","<p></p>"]},"property":"sports","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"d101ecb2-71d3-3082-a365-d24f1062680c","licensed":"true","title":"The Internet is determined to figure out the identities of the couple in this photo","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/internet-determined-figure-identities-couple-154032765.html","summary":"A woman in Queensland, Australia, made a mysterious discoveryÂ behind one of the walls of her home, and now sheâs turning to the...

Obama announced the executive action in late 2014, but it was challenged in court by 26 states, which argued that he had overstepped his authority and that the program would impose an unfair financial burden on them. The program was blocked by federal courts; only a favorable high court ruling this summer would allow Obama to implement it before he leaves office.

The investigation is being led by the Tainan District Prosecutors Office.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j15UEBGPjv9NNX3TC6OsXA--/aD0xMzY1O3c9MjA0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/2fdc738ae2a5be068f0f6a7067009f4c.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"2047","height":"1365"}},{"followId":"72747640-bbce-11e5-9751-fa163e2c24a6","name":"Stock market falls","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"a7427ea0-1511-37c6-bf29-4ed698dbf02b","cluster_id":"72747640-bbce-11e5-9751-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Stocks end off lows as energy stocks eke out gains","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-open-sharply-lower-oil-143000759.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1910","height":"1000","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B.SILknyUAOmt34udqnaCw--/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTkxMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--951305653.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/apio_mbmDxHWVLFqVxdbhw--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--951305653.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2_cw9..BAmAPi_XhTCUlSw--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--951305653.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-09T05:45:52Z","summary":"U.S. stocks closed off their session lows on Monday amid a late rally in the energy sector.","publisher":"CNBC"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/riNOG3U_iIIWFFC9b2ECTw--/aD0zNjA7dz02Mzk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/xNUv7tDHrLzu0YLYEvWt2w--/YXBwaWQ9eXZpZGVvZmVlZHM7aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7Zmk9ZmlsbA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@76e77b0b-300a-33fe-9fd2-76aa58afd72f_FULL.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"639","height":"360"}},{"followId":"c4937a5e-5e52-11e5-b600-fa163e2c24a6","name":"NFL concussions","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"416d8c06-d4e6-3b1a-aafe-2433a17ec195","cluster_id":"c4937a5e-5e52-11e5-b600-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Concussions May Increase Suicide Risk, Study Finds","link":"https://gma.yahoo.com/concussions-may-increase-suicide-risk-study-finds-204558968.html","image_assets":[{"width":"992","height":"559","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_81dSkY401iu7yYHcSOGMw--/aD01NTk7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1546244556.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2EXImUyPHP6WPLLfwTkpKQ--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1546244556.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Nzso.2dwrbHmqDAIXjr4AQ--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1546244556.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-09T01:29:38Z","summary":"The risks of suffering a concussion have been under the spotlight in recent years, especially as the degenerative neurological illness known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has been found in multiple football players after their deaths.
