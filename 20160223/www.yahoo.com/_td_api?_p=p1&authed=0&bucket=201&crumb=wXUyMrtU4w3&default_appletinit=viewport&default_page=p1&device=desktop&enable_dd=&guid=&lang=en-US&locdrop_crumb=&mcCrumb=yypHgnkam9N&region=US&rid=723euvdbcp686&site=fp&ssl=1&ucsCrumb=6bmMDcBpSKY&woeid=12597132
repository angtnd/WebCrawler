(Reuters) - The Michigan Uber driver charged with murdering six people changed vehicles after sideswiping a car at the start of the shooting spree, authorities said on Tuesday, adding that they hoped his phone would help establish a motive for the killings. Jason Dalton, 45, was denied bail on Monday after a court in which a detective testified that Dalton admitted to the five-hour shooting rampage over the weekend in Kalamazoo, about 150 miles (240 km) west of Detroit. Searching for a motive for the violence, investigators are now focusing on a gun and a cell phone seized from Dalton and reports that he drove fares for the Uber car-hailing service in between the shooting episodes, said Paul Matyas of the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Gccz_BAyUZ6BHpgLtcEu1g--/aD0xODMwO3c9MjQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/6d3700bc6be81009910f6a70670095b9.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"2440","height":"1830"}},{"followId":"ade50c68-5e35-11e5-855e-fa163e2c24a6","name":"U.S.-Cuba relations","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"55c01ede-0bba-394f-bd3f-e3e90ec5fc32","cluster_id":"ade50c68-5e35-11e5-855e-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Obama sends Congress a plan to close Guantanamo Bay","link":"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/obama-sends-congress-a-plan-to-close-guantanamo-163736357.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1188","height":"891","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S_dr_.Krynp1nTtgm.pf5w--/aD04OTE7dz0xMTg4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1526545834.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MXn8zdc5JojDR6x569Km7Q--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1526545834.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JG2SiGyejaJV7M0Q4oIifg--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-1526545834.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-23T17:07:48Z","summary":"In what may be his final push to close Guantanamo Bay before leaving office, President Barack Obama on Tuesday sent Congress a blueprint for emptying the notorious prison of detainees and resettling scores of them in an unspecified facility on U.S. soil.","publisher":"Yahoo Politics"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JPbFZA9q42fUyHQ2F_Ia4g--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://l.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150923/US-Cuba_relations_copy.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"640","height":"360"}},{"followId":"65c24e14-7730-11e5-9f5b-fa163e2c24a6","name":"Ben Carson campaign","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"dd0c549e-430a-3b2f-b2ca-5fb0b214babe","cluster_id":"65c24e14-7730-11e5-9f5b-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"Ben Carson: President Obama was âraised whiteâ","link":"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/ben-carson-president-obama-was-raised-white-161944516.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1280","height":"854","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y1NObov3b5KFHn7dx.y4DQ--/aD04NTQ7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-306769820.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y.1rdOQpsUXvkGnUYj1GiQ--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-306769820.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0.mlvrvPDh2Qg5sDQvdBYA--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-306769820.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-23T16:26:13Z","summary":"Ben Carson, top left, and his wife Candy, top center, pose for a selfie with a young supporter after a town hall meeting Sunday, Feb. 21, 2016, in Reno, Nev.

The first mooted global oil pact in 15 years has so far failed to impress the market, which had expected a production cut instead of a freeze that could even turn into an increase if Iran wins special terms from fellow OPEC members.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PHAYDcKJTtLZ.yF7feoUxQ--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cbstv/4/2/503f5ec5-a8e4-4054-b2ea-790dec0f4a81_0SLbtZomX8C-GOfyn-H-ctbf_NnWXrR8UDDH3RrhllCzqLCL86M9BVpRlD-8Z4zKJ64nebSy5rI-_2_0.jpg?s=778298411d5f8b36b252b52f9361bfce&c=5f8487b9efaf2345e0c4a3f9692580cc&a=cbstv&mr=0","tag":"size=original","width":"640","height":"360"}},{"followId":"0dce7f58-d09e-11e5-960d-fa163e6f4a7e","name":"Fashion Week","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"13986599-9925-3658-a4d2-5a32d730a01c","cluster_id":"0dce7f58-d09e-11e5-960d-fa163e6f4a7e","licensed":"true","title":"NYFW Day 5: Wild & Wonderful with Joe Zee","link":"https://www.yahoo.com/style/nyfw-day-5-wild-wonderful-with-1366674390687798.html","published":"2016-02-17T16:32:17Z","summary":"Zac Posen (gasp!) didnât show a single ball gown, Thom Browne was weird & wonderful, and the Olsen Twins got inspired byâ¦ themselves.

The plan was widely seen as dead on arrival at the Capitol, where Obamaâs on-again, off-again, seven-year campaign to shutter the jail has repeatedly met with Republican-dominated but bipartisan opposition.<br /></p>","<p> âI donât want to pass this problem on to the next president, whoever it is,â Obama told reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. âWith this plan, we have the opportunity, finally, to eliminate a terrorist propaganda tool, strengthen relationships with allies and partners, enhance our national security and most importantly uphold the values that bind us as Americans.â </p>","<p> Lawmakers were expected to reject Obamaâs proposal, raising the possibility that Obama might resort to executive action that could spark a major election-year clash. Congress has repeatedly passed â and the president signed â legislation forbidding the transfer of GuantÃ¡namo Bay detainees to U.S. soil. </p>","<p> The new blueprint reflects months of work by the Obama administration to identify likely destinations for the inmates at the base, which is near Cubaâs southeastern tip. </p>","<p> Officials looked at 13 potential facilities, including state and federal prisons as well as military bases, but the plan does not identify a specific alternative. </p>","<p> âWeâre going to keep making the case to Congress that we can do this in a responsible and secure way,â Obama said. </p>","<p> But Republican Representative Mac Thornberry, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, gave the proposal a chilly welcome. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> âWhat the president submitted today is more press release than a plan,â he said in a statement. âI have pledged to give the presidentâs plan a fair hearing, but he makes it impossible to do so when he withholds critical details.â </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" width=\"640\" alt=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MIhVW5TZ0HYWaisZN6yVBg--/aD00NDY7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/2e26cb2acaf6199e02451c84aafdb2ad\"  height=\"446\"/></span>\n</figure>","<p> The facility at GuantÃ¡namo Bay currently houses 91 detainees, of whom 35 have been cleared for transfer to other countries and may leave âin the next several months,â a senior U.S. official told reporters on a conference call organized by the White House. Another 10 are in the process of being tried by military commissions. The remaining 46 include two dozen whom the government has decided it cannot prosecute but who are thought to be too dangerous to release. The prison population reached its peak in 2003 at about 680 detainees. </p>","<p> On the conference call, U.S. officials told reporters that the plan calls for moving 30-60 prisoners to sites in the United States, where they would continue to be guarded by military personnel. There would be a one-time cost to upgrade the new facility and move the detainees, roughly $290 million to $475 million, the officials said. But the new arrangement would cost $65 million to $85 million less annually. </p>","<p> U.S. officials said on the call that the prisoners would be held under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force that underpins the entire war on terrorism, meaning that they would not acquire new legal rights to challenge their detention if moved to U.S. soil. </p>","<p> In his remarks, Obama noted the sluggish pace of military trials at the tropical base, underlining that not one of those connected to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has been convicted. And he emphasized that federal courts have been far speedier, noting the trials and convictions of âshoe-bomberâ Richard Reid or Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. </p>","<p> Still, the proposed arrangement would confirm Obamaâs tacit acceptance that the United States will indefinitely detain some prisoners without ever bringing them to trial, something likely to anger civil liberties advocates. </p>","<p> And even if Congress were to spin 180 degrees and embrace the plan, it is unclear that the construction and transfer could occur quickly enough for Obama to be able to make good on his 2008 promise to close the facility during his presidency. </p>","<p> Since taking office, Obama has repeatedly argued that the prison serves as a recruitment tool for extremist groups while making it harder for some U.S. allies to cooperate with Washington. Recently, the president has increasingly couched his position in fiscal terms, noting that the facility is enormously expensive. </p>","<p> The proposal is sure to echo across the 2016 presidential campaign battlefield. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic rivals to succeed Obama, both favor closing the prison. The contenders for the Republican nomination oppose doing so. Of the candidates seeking the White House, only Republican Sen. Marco Rubio is known to have visited GuantÃ¡namo Bay. </p>","<p> Some GOP critics have accused the Obama administration â and the Bush administration before it â of being too quick to release prisoners who then attack American interests overseas. Others have worried that bringing detainees to U.S. soil may pose a security risk to American communities. </p>","<p> Few policy battles have defined Obamaâs time in office like this one. </p>","<p> On his first full day in office, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ClosureOfGuantanamoDetentionFacilities\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Obama signed an executive order</a> to close the facility. In his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-barack-obama-address-joint-session-congress\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"> first speech to a joint session of Congress </a> one month later, he said it was important to do so in order to be true to American values. Throughout his tumultuous presidency, Obama has come back again and again to his warning that GuantÃ¡namo Bay serves as a rallying cry for Islamist extremists. </p>","<p> âThe existence of GuantÃ¡namo likely <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-national-security-5-21-09\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">created more terrorists around the world</a> than it ever detained,â he charged in May 2009. </p>","<p> But that same month, one of Obamaâs top liberal allies in Congress dealt the closure plan a blow from which it never really recovered. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey stripped $80 million that Obama had requested to close the prison from an emergency funding bill. </p>","<p> âWhile I donât mind defending a concrete program, Iâm not much interested in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/04/guantanamo.closure/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">wasting my energy defending a theoretical program</a>,â Obey said at the time. âSo when they have a plan, theyâre welcome to come back and talk to us about it.â </p>","<p> The White House response was relatively muted, and some House Democrats who supported Obamaâs call for shuttering GuantÃ¡namo grumbled that Obamaâs chief of staff at the time, Rahm Emanuel, had put doing so on the back burner while the young administration pursued other priorities, like overhauling the U.S. health insurance system. Emanuel was known to have clashed with Greg Craig, the high-powered Washington lawyer to whom Obama entrusted the GuantÃ¡namo Bay closure mission. Craig left the White House in late 2009. </p>","<p> And the plan slammed into Republican-led but bipartisan opposition in Congress. After his 2009 speech, Obama dropped GuantÃ¡namo from his State of the Union speeches in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. </p>","<p> In 2013, the president grew increasingly concerned about a widespread hunger strike among GuantÃ¡namo Bay prisoners â one that the top military official in charge of the base, Marine Gen. John Kelly, essentially laid at Obamaâs feet. </p>","<p> âThey had great optimism that GuantÃ¡namo would be closed,â he told the House Armed Services Committee in March. âThey were devastated when the president, you know, backed offÂ â at least (in) their perceptionÂ â of closing the facility.â </p>","<p> On Tuesday, Obama seemed eager to banish any such doubts. </p>","<p> âI am absolutely committed to closing the detention facility at GuantÃ¡namo,â he said. âIâm going to continue to make the case for doing so as long as I hold this office.â </p>"]},"property":"politics","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"cf6c628d-be02-3d22-8e40-7ee59fb0f219","licensed":"true","title":"Seas are rising way faster than any time in past 2,800 years","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/seas-rising-way-faster-time-past-2-800-200200182.html","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) â Sea levels on Earth are rising several times faster than they have in the past 2,800 years and are accelerating because of man-made global warming, according to new studies.","entities":"WIKIID:Sea_level_rise|WIKIID:Sea_level","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000637|YCT:001000639","publisher":"Associated Press","author":"SETH BORENSTEIN","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/DuBQWBKPA4y5Oei3EAmwGA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://l.yimg.com/os/152/2012/04/21/image001-png_162613.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://www.ap.org/","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"13697051","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"13697051","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Sea_level_rise;Sea_level;Centimetre;Global_warming\" rs=\"lmsid:a077000000IpoJiAAJ;revsp:ap.org;lpstaid:cf6c628d-be02-3d22-8e40-7ee59fb0f219\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"13 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo - ABC News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000637","score":"0.908451","label":"Nature"},{"term":"YCT:001000639","score":"0.5","label":"Climate Change"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>WASHINGTON (AP) â Sea levels on Earth are rising several times faster than they have in the past 2,800 years and are accelerating because of man-made global warming, according to new studies.</p>","<p>An international team of scientists dug into two dozen locations across the globe to chart gently rising and falling seas over centuries and millennia. Until the 1880s and the world's industrialization, the fastest seas rose was about 1 to 1.5 inches (3 to 4 centimeters) a century, plus or minus a bit. During that time global sea level really didn't get much higher or lower than 3 inches above or below the 2,000-year average.</p>","<p>But in the 20th century the world's seas rose 5.5 inches (14 centimeters). Since 1993 the rate has soared to a foot per century (30 centimeters). And two different studies published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said by 2100 that the world's oceans will rise between 11 to 52 inches (28 to 131 centimeters), depending on how much heat-trapping gas Earth's industries and vehicles expel.</p>","<p>\"There's no question that the 20th century is the fastest,\" said Rutgers earth and planetary sciences professor Bob Kopp, lead author of the study that looked back at sea levels over the past three millennia. \"It's because of the temperature increase in the 20th century which has been driven by fossil fuel use.\"</p>","<p>To figure out past sea levels and rates of rise and fall, scientists engaged in a \"geological detective story,\" said study co-author Ben Horton, a Rutgers marine scientist. They went around the world looking at salt marshes and other coastal locations and used different clues to figure out what the sea level was at different times. They used single cell organisms that are sensitive to salinity, mangroves, coral, sediments and other clues in cores, Horton said. On top of that they checked their figures by easy markers such as the rise of lead with the start of the industrial age and isotopes only seen in the atomic age.</p>","<p>When Kopp and colleagues charted the sea level rise over the centuries â they went back 3,000 years, but aren't confident in the most distant 200 years â they saw Earth's sea level was on a downward trend until the industrial age.</p>","<p>Sea level rise in the 20th century is mostly man-made, the study authors said. A separate, not-yet-published study by Kopp and others found since 1950, about two-thirds of the U.S. nuisance coastal floods in 27 locales have the fingerprints of man-made warming.</p>","<p>And if seas continue to rise, as projected, another 18 inches of sea level rise is going to cause lots of problems and expense, especially with surge during storms, said study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>\"There is such a tight relationship between sea level and temperature,\" Horton said. \"I wish there wasn't, then we wouldn't be as worried.\"</p>","<p>The link to temperature is basic science, the study's authors said. Warm water expands. Cold water contracts. The scientists pointed to specific past eras when temperatures and sea rose and fell together.</p>","<p>The Kopp study and a separate one published by another team projected future sea level rise based on various techniques. They came to the same general estimates, despite using different methods, said Anders Levermann, a co-author of the second paper and a researcher at the Potsdam Institute.</p>","<p>If greenhouse gas pollution continues at the current pace, both studies project increases of about 22 to 52 inches (57 to 131 centimeters).

Itâs why Sergio Romo ended a season by throwing the softest, quietest, most hittable fastball ever past Miguel Cabrera. Itâs how the Marlins win as many titles as the Yankees over a decade and a half. There is no why and there is no how, until there is.</p>","<p>Patterns, man. Tendencies. The oddness of the game. The evenness of cool, rational thought.</p>","<p>Which brings us â sort of â to the San Francisco Giants and the straight voodoo of World Series championships of 2010, 2012 and 2014 alongside the relative plagues of 2011, 2013 and 2015, and finally pitchers and catchers reporting in 2016.</p>","<p>Nobody with any wits at all believes in this even-year/odd-year, our-time/their-time hooey, least of all the men in the clubhouse who dreamt it and lived it and have the rings to prove they were there. Except now itâs 2016, so itâs now in their best interest to believe, believe, believe, which is awkward and dumb and entirely believable enough to allay for the moment oneâs suspicion of the totally random pattern, oxymoronic as it sounds. Hey, whatever gets you through the day, right?</p>","<p>Theyâd say they expect to win because theyâre a good ballclub, because theyâve added two starting pitchers and an outfielder, and because they are healthy, none of which has anything to do with the years A.D. being divisible by two. Except they are divisible by two, which is math. And in those years the Giants are magic, which is science.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>And hereâs the other thing: Only once in those odd years were the Giants really lousy. Theyâve hit on what works in a game where you can take your pick, and they won three times with, as general manager Bobby Evans recounted Monday afternoon, three different closers and three different second basemen and so many moving parts Bruce Bochy should work the game on a scooter. Theyâve won in some part because of what we like to call their âculture,â which as a measurable dynamic falls in just behind âvibesâ and just ahead of âa horseshoe in their back pocket.â</p>","<p><span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1456197798774\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Left\"><img title=\"The Giants also added pitcher Johnny Cueto to their rotation.

That can only be a good thing. In the early hours of camp, Matt Cain is letting go of the ball like he did when he was winning 16 games, which could become the most pivotal element of an even year. Tim Lincecum is gone for now, a somewhat jarring reality when thereâs someone else in the corner locker. He did visit the Giantsâ clubhouse earlier in spring, however, and the Giants are expected to attend a showcase later this month in which Lincecum will unveil his new and improved hip. Who knows, maybe Lincecum assents to being their next Yusmeiro Petit. Or, given time, their same old Timmy.</p>","<p>Itâs all a little wispy, these notions of what teams can be great and which ones actually will be. What we know is the Giants have a knack for finding the way, even while people are also touting the Dodgers and the Diamondbacks in their own division, and a handful of teams outside it. Perhaps especially so. At a time of real parity in baseball, the difference between 84 wins and 90 might actually look like the inside of the Giantsâ clubhouse, which looks like everyone elseâs, mostly, but manages more.</p>","<p>Evans, the general manager, took a moment Monday to consider the even-year virtues of his franchise, a not fresh conversation topic. He shook his head.</p>","<p>âWhat we do recognize is the uniqueness of the leadership of the Madison Bumgarners and the Buster Poseys and the Hunter Pences,â he said.</p>","<p>He continued on the blessings of a homegrown infield, a manager who canât be outmaneuvered, owners who see the value of a relevant team in San Francisco. His voice faded as though to suggest he could go on and on, if necessary, but he would never arrive at The Even Year Theory.</p>","<p>âWe all see this,â he said, âas a special time.

Lisa Kudrow reminisced about how Burrows had lent the <em>Friends</em> cast his dressing room so that the famously chummy actors could play poker together between takes. Danny DeVito recalled the Burrowsian tell that, on the set of <em>Taxi</em>, would reveal to his actors when a joke had really, really landed: The director would leap out of his chair and grab his crotch. </span></span></p> So many obituaries make you think, âIt wouldâve been so nice if theyâd been around to read that.â\n  <p dir=\"ltr\"><span><span>Which is the stuffâa mix of funny memories and wistful onesânormally reserved for eulogies and obits.

He got to know, first-hand, some of his friendsâ and co-workersâ favorite memories of him. He got to hear himself, essentially, eulogized. He got to know how loved and appreciated he is while he is still around to acknowledge that love and appreciation. He got to have the same existentially odd but spiritually fulfilling experience that one of his characters, Frasier Crane, did: He <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0582539/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">read his own obituary</a>. Burrowsâs insight into how he will be remembered, however, came not as a result of a sitcomedy of errors, but as a result of months of careful planning. </span></span></p> \n  <span>The best things that will be said about usâpublicly, openly, audiblyâwill not technically be said </span>\n  <em>to</em>\n  <span> us. Eulogies are wasted on the dead. </span>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\"><span><span>We canât all be James Burrows, of course. Indeed, the point of last nightâs proceedings was largely that nobody else can be James Burrows. But his tribute is a reminder of how sadly rare it is that we find ways to praise each other as a matter of cultural ritual. The luckiest celebrities will get feted at the Grammys, or the Golden Globes, or the Kennedy Center Honors. The rest of us will settle, generally, for toasts given at birthday parties and graduation parties and retirement partiesâspeeches meant to carve a little space for celebrating the people we love. Appreciations that can function, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulogy\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Wikipedia informs its readers</a>, as âliving eulogies.â </span></span></p> \n  <p dir=\"ltr\"><span><span>But those secular ceremonies, if they involve praise at all, tend to focus on discrete accomplishmentsâworking, aging, exam-passingârather than overall ones. Wedding toasts tend to focus on couples as a unit rather than as individuals. Professional performance reviews tend to focus on targeted skills. There is no ritual that is meant to tell a person the thingâthe ultimate thingâmany of us want, and need, to hear: âGood job at being a person.â </span></span><span><span>Americans can be awkward about praiseâgiving it and, especially, receiving it. Our customs reflect that. Which has created a situation in which, often, the best things that will be said about usâpublicly, openly, audiblyâwill not technically be said <em>to</em> us. Eulogies are wasted on the dead. NBCâs tribute to Burrows </span>suggests the ways, big and small, that its logic might </span><span> be reclaimed for the living. </span></p> \n  <b>Read more from <i>The Atlantic</i>:</b>\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/planet-earth-sequel-bbc/470382/?utm_source=yahoo\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">The BBC's Classic Nature Series 'Planet Earth' Will Return </a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/some-inescapable-facts-about-hollywoods-diversity-crisis/470340/?utm_source=yahoo\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Some Inescapable Facts About Hollywood's Diversity Crisis</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/02/donald-trump-pope-isis/470307/?utm_source=yahoo\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Donald Trump and the Apocalypse</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/nbc-james-burrows-friends-reunited/470376/?utm_source=yahoo\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">The Atlantic</a>.</p>\n </hr>\n</hr>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"news","images":[{"caption":"NBC&#8217;s televised tribute to the legendary director James Burrows was extremely sappy.
