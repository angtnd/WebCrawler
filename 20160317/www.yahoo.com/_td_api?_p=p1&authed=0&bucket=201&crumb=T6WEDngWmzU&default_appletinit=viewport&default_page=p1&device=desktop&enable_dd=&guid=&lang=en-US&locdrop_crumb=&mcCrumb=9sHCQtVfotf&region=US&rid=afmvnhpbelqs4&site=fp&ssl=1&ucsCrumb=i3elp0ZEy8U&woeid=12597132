extremely rare move of invoking a 1948 international genocide treaty, drafted in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust, as a means of ramping up global pressure against the Islamic State group. The treaty commits signatory nations to take steps to âprevent and to punishâ the âodious scourgeâ of genocide.</p>","<p>At the time, the administration was primarily focused on invoking the treaty because of the Islamic State groupâs actions against the small Yazidi community in northern Iraq, including mass executions of males and sexual enslavement of women and children<i>.</i> </p>","<figure width=\"1007\" height=\"699\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/fv6VlkfDnOCjL5kE02JFuA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/364a9b383510a75164b40c664e3ba913/tumblr_inline_o46xjmwRPC1tdgnv1_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"444.25024826216486\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Newly released members of the minority Yazidi sect hug each other on the outskirts of Kirkuk on April 8, 2015.

The Knights of Columbus began running TV ads highlighting ISIS atrocities. Presidential candidates â including Hillary Clinton and John Kasich â endorsed the calls, and the House unanimously passed a resolution favoring a broader designation. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> Today Kerry answered those calls, declaring Shia Muslims and Christians victims of genocide as well. State Department officials said the U.S. intelligence community had helped gather evidence of executions and mass graves in support of the designation. </p>","<p> âDaesh kills Christians because they are Christians,â Kerry said. âIt kills Shia because they are Shia. It kills Yazidis because theyâre Yazidis.â</p>","<p>In reaching his decision, Kerry had asked the U.S. intelligence community to assist State Department officials to help collect comprehensive information on mass graves, executions Â and other Islamic State atrocities, according to Rabbi David Saperstein, the State Department ambassador at large for international religious freedom, who along with other department human rights officials had pushed for the designation. Â Â <br /></p>","<p>âThe genocide treaty was created as a way for the world to say there are certain crimes that are so abhorrent to the conscience of humanity that they must be called for what they are,â said Saperstein. âThis is a historical designation that hopefully will galvanize the conscience of the world.â<br /></p>","<p> The move won immediate praise from members of Congress who had been advocating for the designation. One leading member said it will bring a ânew cause for hopeâ to threatened minority groups.</p>","<figure width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/SyMYr8BVe0bA5EETmw9ilg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/22664ce238672c0812b7eb92bc3d9ea8/tumblr_inline_o46xl9arnj1tdgnv1_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"447.36\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Displaced Iraqi Christians at St. Joseph Church in Irbil, northern Iraq, on Aug. 7, 2014.

Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska, the lead sponsor of the House genocide resolution. âThe United States has now spoken with clarity and moral authority. I sincerely hope that the genocide designation will raise international consciousness, end the scandal of silence, and create the preconditions for the protection and reintegration of these ancient faith communities into their ancestral homelands.â </p>","<p> The U.S. has rarely invoked the genocide treaty. The last instance came more than a decade ago when Secretary of State Colin Powell declared the killing of non-Arab people in Darfur genocide. That was the first time the U.S. government had made such a declaration during an ongoing conflict. But it remains unclear what practical impact todayâs move will have on U.S. military strategy. Administration officials have privately insisted the Pentagon is already committed to a strategy aimed at destroying the group, and said the genocide designation will not change its military plans. </p>","<p> But advocates say the move is an important step toward mobilizing a broader international effort to seek out and protect the threatened minority groups, including rescuing thousands of women still being held as sexual slaves by ISIS. Kerry said today that the move would also commit the U.S. to gathering evidence of Islamic State group atrocities, presumably for international war crimes trials that could be held after the group is defeated and its leaders captured. </p>"]},"property":"politics","author":"Michael Isikoff","images":[{"caption":"ISIS committing âgenocideâÂ against minorities, U.S. declares","id":"19a75aa2-8305-31ec-b8aa-9d14a5699942","title":"ISIS committing âgenocideâÂ against minorities, U.S. declares","type":"photo","shortCaption":"ISIS committing âgenocideâÂ against minorities, U.S. declares","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/XW.PpWonmH6vtQGGN6VWJg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/93a2db8010769a2d30b3f5251157bf11","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"ISIS committing âgenocideâÂ against minorities, U.S. declares","id":"2e930f42-5094-3c2b-9b74-9f3d47f7a0c6","title":"ISIS committing âgenocideâÂ against minorities, U.S. declares","type":"photo","shortCaption":"ISIS committing âgenocideâÂ against minorities, U.S. declares","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/8neEma47sS7l85MX.l1qZQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d7f285ad7778ca753f9db47b47c1bf61","alt":null},"index":2},{"caption":"FIL - In this March 9, 2016, file photo, Secretary of State John Kerry speaks to reporters at the State Department in Washington.

The two-and-a-half minute clip is a cornucopia of mutant action, clearly drawing the battle lines between Xavierâs first class mutants and the âFour Horsemenâ aiding the ancient baddie, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac). Watch Olivia Munn wield Psylockeâs energy sword against Nicholas Houltâs furry beast, while winged warrior Angel (Ben Hardy) fruitlessly tries to land a punch against teleporting Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The trailer also hints at increased screen time for <i>Days of Future Past </i>scene-stealer Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and the burgeoning romance between young Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) and Cyclops (Tye Sheridan). And since this could be Singerâs swan song, you can almost certainly expect a Wolverine cameo somewhere in the final product.

Filling out a bracket demands that you look ahead and envision the matchups to come. It is both human nature and part of the March Madness deal.</p>","<p>So we dare to dream.</p>","<p>We dream of Kentucky vs. Indiana, a matchup of programs that have won 13 national titles between them. We dream of two high-and-mighty bluebloods playing with their tournament lives on the line, as they have four times before (all-time tourney scoreboard: UK 3, IU 1). We dream of neighboring basketball-mad states separated by not just a river, but a regional identity â South vs. Midwest, SEC vs. Big Ten. We dream of the resumption, at least for a day, of a great rivalry that was shamefully discontinued four years ago after 56 meetings between 1924-2012.</p>","<p>There will be time to plow back over the excuses, egos and finger-pointing that went into killing off one of the very best series in the sport later. There will be time to discuss the biggest win of Crean's tenure at Indiana, the buzzer-beater to knock off No. 1 Kentucky in December 2011, and the payback Kentucky exacted in the NCAA tourney later that season on the way to the national title.</p>","<p>There will be time for all of that â if both teams win. Until then, nobody in blue and nobody in crimson is interested in talking about each other. There are two elephants in the room, and everyone at Indiana and Kentucky is talking about the gnats instead.</p>","<p>\"They're all aware of who is in the bracket,\" Crean said of his players. \"Our coaches will work ahead [on scouting Kentucky]. I haven't and we certainly haven't done any preparation for another game inside of the preparation that we have done for this.\"</p>","<p>Fine. If the combatants insist on shrinking the focus to the next game, I suppose we can stop dreaming and address what has to happen first.</p>","<p>And here's the truth: Both the Hoosiers and Wildcats are playing dangerous opponents that could ruin a beautiful storyline. They might be gnats in terms of program stature, but they might be giant-killers come Thursday. We've seen plenty of those over the years.</p>","<p><span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1458177361757\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Right\"><img title=\"The Hoosiers open the tournament against Chattanooga.

Both the Seawolves and Wildcats lost to the Commodores in Nashville, but Stony Brook actually came closer to winning â it pushed Vandy into overtime, while UK lost by 12 in regulation. NJIT lost to Stony Brook by 22 at home and to Kentucky by 30 on the road.</p>","<p>Kentucky coach John Calipari said he watched Stony Brook's comeback win in the America East tournament Saturday from his hotel room in Nashville and came away impressed.</p>","<p>\"I said, 'Hope we don't play them,'Â \" Calipari recalled here, launching another in a long-running series of selection committee conspiracy jokes. \"Did not know that my room was bugged by the NCAA. When they heard that, they said, 'That's who they're playing. We'll work the field around them.' But anyway, they're good. Our team knows they're good.\"</p>","<p>The best part of Stony Brook is post player Jameel Warney, a 6-foot-8, 260-pound strongman who can attack Kentucky's interior weakness. The hard part for the Seawolves will be dealing with the UK backcourt tandem of Tyler Ulis and Jamal Murray, which is merely the best in America.</p>","<p>\"Being able to see them anytime you turn on ESPN or any sports channel, it kind of gave us a head start [on scouting],\" forward Rayshaun McGrew said. \"We kind of know what the guys are about. And us being a low program, we're under the radar. So I feel like we have got our first step on them right now in our advantage.\"</p>","<p>For Indiana, it must confront an opponent that will be every bit as comfortable ripping and running as the Hoosiers are. Chattanooga has won a school-record 29 games with pressure defense that creates turnovers and also disrupts an opponent's half-court offense. Indiana is prone to committing turnovers, which could make dealing with that press paramount.</p>","<p>Beyond tactics, there is this: The Mocs showed their chops by going 3-1 this year against \"name\" opponents.
