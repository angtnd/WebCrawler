Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said in a statement late Wednesday the NAACP were taking issue with the grand jury secrecy only because the group disagreed with the decision not to charge the officers involved in the November 2014 shooting.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xBu_039HBd4AWZju4rUfow--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://l.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/151028/rice.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"640","height":"360"}},{"followId":"7a639110-8249-11e5-9e18-fa163e2c24a6","name":"Keystone pipeline","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"ffd0ccfe-98eb-3719-8d3f-d9e5b2a451e9","cluster_id":"7a639110-8249-11e5-9e18-fa163e2c24a6","licensed":"true","title":"TransCanada sues U.S. over Keystone XL pipeline rejection","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/transcanada-sues-u-over-keystone-xl-pipeline-rejection-000708491--finance.html","image_assets":[{"width":"450","height":"293","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I4Azod7YqeSCfCF.rpZkQA--/aD0yOTM7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--2139936553.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZXsk.eJr4N5fOk17YdaWwg--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--2139936553.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kxAaq4MW4HVfQ.oh13yQOg--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor--2139936553.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-01-07T02:34:37Z","summary":"By Nia Williams and Valerie Volcovici CALGARY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp sued the U.S government on Wednesday to reverse President Barack Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, and also plans to seek $15 billion in damages from a trade tribunal.

serve as pall bearers, ushering out New England's pursuit of perfection as it was they who carried the giant, gleaming Lombardi Trophy out of University of Phoenix Stadium.</p>","<p>New York's defense had held the Patriots' explosive offensive in check, and the teams had scored just 24 combined points when the two-minute mark of the fourth quarter hit. It was a far cry from the nearly 37 points a game New England had posted throughout the season.</p>","<p>The Giants faced third and 5 from their own 44-yard line with 1 minute, 15 seconds to play. The Patriots' defenders closed in on quarterback Eli Manning quickly, with Adalius Thomas coming from his blind side, making Manning slide forward in the rapidly-closing pocket. Defensive tackles Jarvis Green and Richard Seymour followed, with Green getting a good grasp of Manning's white jersey and Seymour getting his hands on him too.</p>","<p>Somehow, Manning stayed on his feet, backpedaled several steps, and heaved the ball about 40 yards downfield, where little-used receiver David Tyree (he'd had just four catches in the regular season but three in the game) and Patriots safety Rodney Harrison both leapt to claim it.</p>","<p><div class=\"Mb-20\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/245496208&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" style=\"width:100%;height:166\"></iframe></div></p>","<p>Tyree got both hands on the ball, pinning it to his helmet with his right hand. His vice grip was strong enough to maintain possession even as Harrison wrestled him down to the grass, pulling on Tyree's right arm, bending the receiver backwards over his thigh as they fell back to Earth.</p>","<p><span class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n  <div style=\"left:0px;\" id=\"ymh-player-swf\" class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\">\n   <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><div class=\"js-video-placeholder RatioBox Bgc-x Bd-0\" data-yepConfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;page_space_id&quot;:&quot;2143969880&quot;,&quot;video_uuid&quot;:&quot;75089cfd-1dd9-3da3-a589-1b82cece445c&quot;,&quot;device&quot;:&quot;desktop&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;sports&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{&quot;showTitle&quot;:true,&quot;showDescription&quot;:true,&quot;showButton&quot;:true,&quot;showProvider&quot;:false},&quot;width&quot;:640}\"></div></div>\n  </div></span>Four plays later, the Giants scored, on a Manning-to-Plaxico Burress pass, and the Patriots' attempt at a game-winning drive fell dead.</p>","<p>It was a funeral, just as New York had planned. A red, white, and blue confetti-covered funeral.</p>","<p>The amazing catch vaulted Tyree into football's lore, but it was the last catch he ever made in an NFL uniform. He missed the 2008 season to injury, and played briefly with the Baltimore Ravens in 2009 before retiring with 54 catches in 83 career-regular-season games, and four more in the postseason, all of them in that 2007 run by the Giants.</p>","<p>\"In some ways, I look at the catch as the culmination of a lot of things in my life,\" <a href=\"http://mmqb.si.com/2015/01/29/nfl-david-tyree-super-bowl-xlii-glendale-arizona\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Tyree told The MMQB in 2015</a>. \"It was really a culmination of a journey of faith and adversity and that's why it's so significant for me personally. Because from the time I was a kid, I wanted to be remembered. I don't know why. It was just one of those things as a kid where I would hear about other people who had somebody significant in their family, and I just wanted to be remembered for something like that. â¦</p>","<p>\"So that catch was really the embodiment of my desire that I had even as a young man, not even knowing what my life would hold. It's a story of faith, of seeing your faithful promise from God come to pass. So there's a lot behind the scenes that most people would never really grasp, and it really is so much more than just a catch.\"</p>","<p>Tyree is remembered, with great fondness by Giants fans, and something less than that by Patriots fans. But he is, undoubtedly, remembered.</p>","<p><strong>More NFL coverage:</strong></p>","<p><strong><span class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n   <div style=\"left:0px;\" id=\"ymh-player-swf\" class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\">\n    <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><div class=\"js-video-placeholder RatioBox Bgc-x Bd-0\" data-yepConfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;page_space_id&quot;:&quot;2143969880&quot;,&quot;video_uuid&quot;:&quot;d8d01877-c0e3-32f4-8d4c-8ac4d127df6c&quot;,&quot;device&quot;:&quot;desktop&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;sports&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{&quot;showTitle&quot;:true,&quot;showDescription&quot;:true,&quot;showButton&quot;:true,&quot;showProvider&quot;:false},&quot;width&quot;:640}\"></div></div>\n   </div></span></strong></p>"]},"property":"sports","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"f4f3ee05-cd30-3730-83d2-ce091d1edd32","licensed":"true","title":"Ex-banker&#39;s new novel gives an inside look at what&#39;s wrong with Wall Street","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ex-banker-s-new-novel-gives-inside-look-at-what-s-wrong-with-wall-street-195629325.html","summary":"The 2008 financial crisis rocked the global markets as the collapse of mortgage-backed securities put the economy on the edge of collapse.

It's the latest addition to a number of books, plays, and movies about Wall Street before, during, and after the 2008 collapse.</p>","<p>âI had never personally read a story that took you inside a trading floor and showed it from a womanâs perspective,â Sherry told Yahoo Financeâs Alexis Christoforous in the video above. âI wanted to do a very relatable story about pay inequity and harassment.â</p>","<p>Even though it's a novel, there are a number of scenarios in the book that are pulled from her own experience.</p>","<p>âMuch of the [sexual harassment] has gone undercover. I think there are episodes that happen in a less aggressive way,â said Sherry. âWhat is very current and very quantifiable now is pay inequity.â</p>","<p>Bloomberg recently <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-20/the-real-cost-of-an-mba-is-different-for-men-and-women\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">released a study</a> focusing on gender pay inequities that found that the payoff from an MBA is drastically different for men and women. Women who graduated from Columbia Business School between 2007 to 2009 earned a median of $170,000 in 2014, while their male equals pulled in $270,000.</p>","<p>While these unveilings may be alarming to women, Sherry believes females are crucial to a bank's success.Â  She says that the 2008 financial crisis would have played out differently had more women been in executive positions making decisions, because, she believes, women are not as risk-prone as men.</p>","<p>And the book is already attracting Hollywoodâs attention. Reese Witherspoon and Bruna Papandreaâs Pacific Standard banner is developing a film version for Warner Bros.</p>","<p>â[The Filmmakers] are very interested in how women are going about controlling their lives when they have a family,â said Sherry. âTheyâre trying to explore that because they want to know how we can all do it better. â</p>","<p>Pacific Standard is devoted to finding and developing female-driven content.</p>","<p>âIn the more senior positions, we havenât figured out how to incorporate the moms into the workplace because itâs so all-in,â said Sherry. âI think the feeling of not being a team player by someone who also has another big job, which is in your home, is something that women really struggle with.â</p>","<p>Â </p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"d705793e-c925-3614-9ab1-5359f17389bd","licensed":"true","title":"Lawyer: Mexican Actress Willing to Talk About Drug Capo","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/mexico-actress-sought-questioning-el-chapo-161453858.html","summary":"An attorney for actress Kate del Castillo said Thursday she is willing to talk to Mexican authorities about her encounters with Joaquin âEl Chapoâ Guzman and felt âbetrayedâ and âusedâ by actor Sean Penn, who wrote a lengthy article about his meeting with the drug kingpin after the actress introduced","entities":"WIKIID:Harland_Braun|WIKIID:Kate_del_Castillo|WIKIID:Del_Castillo|WIKIID:Sean_Penn","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000031|YCT:001000667|YCT:001000780","publisher":"Associated Press","author":"E.J.

Gomez stressed she is officially considered a witness and has not been accused of any crime.</p>","<p>The clandestine meeting took place last October as Del Castillo explored the possibility of developing a movie about the capo, and Pennâs Rolling Stone interview was published Jan. 9, a day after Guzman was recaptured in a raid in the city of Los Mochis.</p>","<p>âShe didnât know Penn was going to write for Rolling Stone. Would you meet with âEl Chapoâ and approve to have the interview for publication?â Braun said. âAfter the interview she had no choice about it. Once Penn and Guzman agreed on the article, what was she going to do? She signed off after they had done so.â</p>","<p>âThatâs what made her feel really betrayed by these people,â he said, referring to Penn and two people who accompanied him. âThe three of them go together and basically used her and didnât tell her.â</p>","<p>In Pennâs Rolling Stone article, he was vague about whether he had told Del Castillo about the story prior to the meeting with Guzman.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>âIt was then that I posed the idea of a magazine story,â Penn wrote. âEspinozaâs smile of mischief arose, indicating he would arrange for me to meet Kate back in Los Angeles. At a Santa Monica restaurant, I made my case, and Kate agreed to make the bridge, sending our names for vetting across the border.â</p>","<p>While Mexican officials have not sought to question Penn, Braun assured that Del Castillo is willing to talk.</p>","<p>âIn the course of the investigation they are going to talk to her, right?â Braun said. âIf we receive proper information and credentials, sheâll talk to them. Sheâs not hiding anything.â</p>","<p>But Braun suggested she would prefer to talk in the United States, noting âthereâs a treaty in the U.S. that says that Mexico can come here and question people.â</p>","<p>As far as reprisals â Mexican officials have said Del Castilloâs contacts with Guzman helped them almost catch the drug lord in an October raid â Braun said she had no fear.</p>","<p>âWeâre not afraid of anything 'cause she didnât do anything to hurt anyone,â he said. âShe didnât do this to expose Mr. Guzman.â</p>","<p>Braun said âthe Mexican government knows that thereâs no money laundering. â</p>","<p>âYou can find out very quickly by looking financial records,â he said.</p>","<p>He also denied there was any relationship between Guzman and Del Castillo.</p>","<p>The Mexican newspaper Milenio recently published a series of text messages between del Castillo and âEl Chapoâ in which the drug lord showed more interest in the actress than in Penn. The two had planned to meet again, and the messages sometimes veered into a flirting tone and gushing expressions of mutual admiration.</p>","<p>A federal official confirmed the messages were authentic.</p>","<p>âHe obviously was a fan of hers. She was trying to encourage him because he wanted to make a movie about his life. Thatâs it,â Braun said. âTheyâre obviously friendly but thatâs it.â</p>","<p>âYou would not, if youâre trying to make a movie about a personâs life, antagonize them, right?â</p>","<p>Earlier Thursday, two Mexican security officials said federal prosecutors had issued the search order for Del Castillo because the movie and telenovela star did not voluntarily appear before authorities to give a statement as requested. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p>","<p>The officials said the order applies only to Mexican territory and added that if Del Castillo were found to be in the country, she would be detained to make a statement as a witness and then released after doing so.</p>","<p>Braun said Del Castillo, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was currently in Los Angeles, where she has lived for years.</p>","<p>He declined to comment on her legal situation in Mexico or whether he had been contacted by U.S. authorities.</p>","<p>Del Castillo recently sought a court injunction that would bar Mexican authorities from detaining her, although the judge asked her lawyers for more specifics before proceeding with the case.</p>","<p>Mexican authorities say the October meeting between Guzman, Del Castillo and Penn in the mountains of northwestern Mexico helped them locate the cartel leader, though he escaped arrest on that occasion.</p>","<p>Del Castillo has appeared in movies and TV shows produced in the United States, Mexico and elsewhere including âWeedsâ and âLa Reina del Sur.â</p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/actor-sean-penn-tells-60-175753988.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>","<p>Associated Press writer E.

Sanders<b> </b>has been in Congress since 1991, and despite his Independent designation, has caucused with Democrats in the Senate and has been a reliable vote for leaders. </p>","<p> âSen. Sanders is the only person who would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president<b>,</b> as exemplifying the establishment. And Iâve got to tell you, it is really quite amusing to me,â Clinton said. âPeople support me because they know me, they know my lifeâs work, they have worked with me and many have also worked with Sen. Sanders. And at the end of the day, theyâve endorsed me because they know I can get things done.â </p>","<p> Clintonâs effort to frame herself as anti-establishment just because she is a woman is complicated by the fact that she already has lived in the White House for eight years, served as a senator for the same length of time and was secretary of state during President Obamaâs first term. Itâs also at odds with her core argument that she is the best person to protect the Obama administrationâs priorities, as the sitting president is often considered the most powerful person in his partyâs establishment. </p>","<p> Moreover, the political differences between Democrats, no matter how stark Sanders in particular tries to paint them, are much less pronounced than on the Republican side, where an existential conflict exists between a small- government, pro-business wing and a far-right conservative faction that is largely antigovernment. </p>","<p> By reacting so aggressively to the âestablishmentâ moniker, Clinton is in effect validating the idea that a history in Democratic politics is a negative against a candidate who wants to be the partyâs leader and whose top claim to being qualified for that job is deep experience. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> In one of the most charged moments of the night, Clinton called on Sanders and his campaign to end their âartful smearâ of accusing her of being part of traditional Democratic machinery. </p>","<p> âSen. Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign; Iâve tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be. But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to: âAnybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.â And I just absolutely reject that, senator. And I really donât think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you. Enough is enough. If you have something to say, say it directly,â Clinton said. </p>","<p> âI have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and Iâm very proud of that,â Clinton continued. âItâs time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks.â </p>"]},"property":"politics","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"dd3e68e1-42eb-3b41-90db-966070c4f9d5","licensed":"true","title":"A 911 Call Sheds New Light On The Peyton Manning Doping Scandal","link":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/911-call-peyton-manning-doping_us_56b42379e4b04f9b57d92158?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592","summary":"After Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning learned he was going to be tied to a doping scandal in an upcoming investigation by Al Jazeera, his lawyers sent two private investigators to find the key source, Charlie Sly.Sly, who was secretly recorded by Al Jazeera, had made a slew of allegations,","entities":"WIKIID:Peyton_Manning|WIKIID:Al_Jazeera|WIKIID:Denver_Broncos|WIKIID:Private_investigator","categories":"YCT:001000667","publisher":"Huffington Post","author":"Ryan Grim","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"","provider_url":"http://huffingtonpost.com","site":"frontpage","region":"us","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"1197762606","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"1197762606","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Peyton_Manning;Al_Jazeera;Denver_Broncos;Private_investigator\" rs=\"lmsid:a0Vd0000003rEIvEAM;revsp:huffingtonpost.com.rss;lpstaid:dd3e68e1-42eb-3b41-90db-966070c4f9d5\"","site":"offnetwork","region":"us","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":false,"publicationDate":"12 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000667","score":"0.7","label":"Crime & Justice"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>After Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning learned he was going to be tied to a doping scandal in an upcoming investigation by Al Jazeera, his lawyers sent two private investigators to find the key source, Charlie Sly.Sly, who was secretly recorded by Al Jazeera, had made a slew of allegations, including some against Manning.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) closed a 30-point gap with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to virtually tie her in a new national survey published Friday. <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2321\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">poll</a>, from Quinnipiac University, found Clinton leading Sanders among national Democratic primary voters, 44% to 42%.</p> <p>That was a wild swing from a mid-December Quinnipiac poll that found Clinton leading 61% to 30% nationally over Sanders.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Democrats nationwide are feeling the Bern as Sen. Bernie Sanders closes a 31-point gap to tie Secretary Hillary Clinton,\" said Tim Malloy, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\">The Quinnipiac survey is the most bullish for Sanders on a national scale recently. Clinton remained ahead of Sanders in a Real Clear Politics <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">average</a> of recent national surveys by about 13 points.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Still, the Friday survey presented fresh signs of momentum for Sanders, who surprised much of the political world when he came <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-iowa-results-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">close to overtaking Clinton in the Monday-night Iowa caucuses</a>. He also appears primed for a win in New Hampshire, which holds its primaries next Tuesday; he's up by more than 20 points in an average of recent polls of the state.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The Quinnipiac poll found that Sanders would fare better than Clinton in hypothetical general-election matchups, an argument he has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-general-election-polls-2016-1\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">started to make on the campaign trail</a>. For example, while Clinton would lose to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) by 7 points, Sanders would tie him, according to the survey. He would also double Clinton's margin of victory over real-estate magnate Donald Trump.</p> <p class=\"p1\">For his part, Trump continued to lead on the Republican side, according to Quinnipiac. He received 31% of the vote, followed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas at 22% and Rubio at 19%.</p> <p>NOW WATCH: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-debate-heated-moment-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-wall-street-speaking-fee-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">'If you've got something to say, say itâ â hereâs the most heated moment from last nightâs Democratic debate</a></p><br /><br /><b>More From Business Insider </b><br />\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-wall-street-bernie-sanders-msnbc-debate-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">'Enough is enough': Hillary Clinton tells Bernie Sanders to stop smearing her over Wall Street money</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Hillary Clinton came out swinging at the Democratic debate: 'I am not making promises that I cannot keep'</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-debate-live-watch-hillary-bernie-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders just had their first direct face-off</a><br /></li>\n  </ul></p> </p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"bc6562d3-a92a-3c0d-9bee-25ce1be9a3f8","licensed":"true","title":"Bernie Sanders Wonders Whether Flint&#39;s Water Crisis Would Happen In A White Community","link":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-debate-flint_us_56b41d5ee4b04f9b57d92084?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592","summary":"Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders wondered during Thursday&#39;s Democratic debate whether a toxic water crisis like the one in Flint, Michigan, would happen to a town that&#39;s not majority black.&quot;One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would","entities":"WIKIID:Bernie_Sanders","categories":"YCT:001000085","publisher":"Huffington Post","author":"Arthur Delaney","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"","provider_url":"http://huffingtonpost.com","site":"frontpage","region":"us","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"1197762606","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"1197762606","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Bernie_Sanders;Flint,_Michigan\" rs=\"lmsid:a0Vd0000003rEIvEAM;revsp:huffingtonpost.com.rss;lpstaid:bc6562d3-a92a-3c0d-9bee-25ce1be9a3f8\"","site":"offnetwork","region":"us","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":false,"publicationDate":"13 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000085","score":"0.7","label":"Social Media"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p>Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders wondered during Thursday's Democratic debate whether a toxic water crisis like the one in Flint, Michigan, would happen to a town that's not majority black.\"One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been,\" Sanders said, to cheers from the...</p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"news"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"ef2920ae-27cf-3f1a-9e6e-f359c94f9913","licensed":"true","title":"Hereâs Why Bernie Sanders Didnât Use Public Funding for His Campaign","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bernie-sanders-didn-t-031015399.html","summary":"&quot;Why aren&#39;t you walking the walk on that?&quot;

Simpson: American Crime Story</a></i> has renewed interest in the so-called âTrial of the Centuryâ and the real-life cast of characters tied to the 1994 murders of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman are again back in the spotlight. While weâre not surprised Kato Kaelin live-tweeted the premiere â he never minded the spotlight â we canât help but think of the littlest victims, Brown and Simpsonâs children, who have tried to live their lives out of the public eye.</p>","<p> On Tuesday, the day <i>ACS</i> premiered, the coupleâs daughter, Sydney, was photographed â a rare occurrence â while she walked her dog in her St. Petersburg, Florida, neighborhood. Now 30, she was wearing jeans and a purple cardigan and looked so different than the tiny dancer whose ballet recital sparked drama between her divorced parents on that fateful night. </p>","<p> Itâs been longer since weâve seen Justin, who broke our hearts carrying a single white flower at his motherâs funeral. He also lives in St. Petersburg, where he is a real estate agent for Coldwell Banker. The 27-year-old, who like his sister physically resembles both his parents, was photographed looking dapper in a gray suit at his grandfather Lou Brownâs funeral in 2014. He was 5 and his sister was 8 when their mother was bludgeoned while they slept in their Brentwood, California, condo. Their dad, of course, was found not guilty of the crime, but was later found liable in a civil suit.</p>","<p> Nicoleâs sister Tanya spoke about Sydney and Justin in the <i><a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/Nicole-brown-simpson-sister-speaks-out-tv-series-oj-simpson-trial\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">People</a></i> magazine cover story about the case last week. The article implied that they still face pain every day. However, âthey are so well-grounded,â she said, adding, âIâm so proud of what and who<b> </b>theyâve become.â</p>"],"remaining_body":["<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/yp0I_kwGx88m6GK_nSSvgg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/3d5c88bddfbe64fd30ffcf0e5ee60304/tumblr_inline_o21ikxkwjJ1sisj8i_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"979.6113602391629\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><b><i>The children with their parents at the premiere of </i>Naked Gun 33 1/3<i>: </i>The Final Insult <i>in 1994.

She said that they went to college and theyâre both âprofessional,â adding, âTheyâre in relationships. Theyâre happy. Theyâre just like us. Quote unquote.âÂ </p>","<p>While their father is now serving a 33-year sentence for stealing back some of his sports memorabilia at gunpoint, after the trial he shared custody of the children with the Brown family after a five-year custody battle. (Their grandmother, Juditha, had legal guardianship of the pair, but Simpson had physical custody.)<br /></p>","<p>âI had to go and pick the kids up at the house where he lived,â Tanya told Radar. âIt was hard for me, but I did itâ¦ I had to put on the face because this is their dad. They will always love their dad. I choose to respect that.â<br /></p>","<p><b><i>Related: <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/tv/the-o-j-simpson-trial-1356152230182966.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">The O.J.

(Kris, of course, was best friends with Nicole while her ex, Robert Kardashian, was pals with O.J.)</p>","<p>âI donât see them nearly as much as I used to, but I did have Sydney for a few days this summer,â she said. âTheyâre OK.â Kris noted that the children never asked her questions about their late mother â or their dad â but she wasnât trying to hide anything if they did. âI donât take down the pictures I have of Nicole,â she said. âThey see their motherâs face and they see her presence. They know their mom is in heaven. They have a great love for their mommy.â</p>","<p>When Sydney and Justin were 14 and 12, they moved away from California â and the Browns â to live in Florida with their dad. They urged their grandmother, who was their guardian, to let them go. A family spokesperson told <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=96259&page=1\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">ABC News</a> at the time, âThe children said to their grandmother, âI want to be with my father.ââÂ </p>","<p>In Tanyaâs interview with Radar, she also said that she never spoke to the children about Nicoleâs murder or O.J.âs alleged part in it, calling it theÂ âpink elephant in the room that I hope never shows up.â And when she does spend time with them, she makes sure itâs a fun, positive experience.Â </p>","<p>âIâm the aunt that when they come to visit, itâs âLetâs go to a movie! Letâs go shopping! Letâs go to the beach!â Theyâve probably talked about it on their own,â she admitted. âBut when they come to our house we have fun. We donât need to rehash everything.â</p>","<p> So Kato Kaelin can be left to do the live-tweeting. Sydney and Justin are off living their lives â on their own terms and mostly out of the spotlight, except when things likeÂ <i>The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story</i> get people talking about their family again.</p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/hear-kris-jenner-o-j-215933381.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>"]},"property":"celebrity","images":[{"caption":"See Nicole Brown and O.J.

Fortunately, she was there to think fast and undo the painful tourniquet. <br /><br /> \"Luckily for Molly, she has a mother with medical emergency superpowers who was able to remove the hair with tweezers and a magnifying glass within a few minutes,\" Walker wrote. <br /><br />\"This picture was taken about 45 minutes after the hair was removed. Unfortunately, the hair managed to cut all the way through Molly's skin, completely around her toe, but it could have been worse had it gone much longer untreated, or if the hair wasn't accessible.\" <br /><br /> \n <div id=\"vid\" class=\"brightcovePlayerInline\"> \n </div></p>","<p> \n <div id=\"video-4100869985001\" class=\"video-module\"> \n </div></p>","<p> \n <div class=\"video-placeholder\"></div> </p>","<p> \n <div class=\"video-share\"></div> </p>","<p> \n <div class=\"clear\"></div> </p>","<br>","<p> <br />Walker says that his doctor made sure to tell the family \"to always check the toes if the baby is inconsolable\". <br /><br />As far as spreading the word about this common danger, the dad's post seems to achieved its mission.
