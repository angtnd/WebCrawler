Donald Trump added to the logjam, reducing Jeb Bush to squirming his way around Trump and Carson. Why did this happen? Apparently Carson didnât hear his name called, and ABCâs bumbling at getting the men out of the cattle chute was certainly a funny way to start things off, lending the proceedings a clownish tone.</p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/awkward-introductions-gop-hampshire-debate-052309581.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>","<p>That tone changed abruptly once everyone was finally coaxed into their spots, however. After Rubio dodged a question about his experience in the Senate by bringing up President Obama and batting him around, Chris Christie chastised Rubio, calling Rubioâs spiel a âmemorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is [and it] doesnât help one person.â <br /></p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>How did Rubio respond? <i>By repeating the same 30-second speech</i>, nearly word-for-word. Remarkably, Rubio did the exact same thing a few minutes later. The effect was to leave a viewer thinking Rubio is either obsessed with his Obama rhetoric, or that he was at a loss as to how to improvise clear answers. For a man who, going into this debate, was seen as an up-and-coming challenger to frontrunners Trump and Cruz, the debate represented some fizzled steam. <br /></p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ze1CSU9A2mI?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>","<p>Trump was booed by the audience when he tried to stop a Bush criticism of him. âLet me talk â quiet,â commanded Trump, putting a finger to his lips as one might shush a noisy child. The crowd did not like that condescending move. Trump, ever-unpredictable, responded with something I havenât seen before: He <i>attacked the studio audience</i>, suggesting that the hall was full of âdonorsâ who were unhappy that he, Trump, doesnât take donations. So the audience booed <i>that</i>. It was a crazy-fox strategy: risk alienating the relatively few people in the auditorium in order to regale the millions watching at home. Not sure how that plays to New Hampshire citizens voting on Tuesday.</p>","<p>The tumult of the debate was due solely to the candidates themselves; the debateâs primary moderators, David Muir and Martha Raddatz, were mostly tedious questioners, too often quoting one candidateâs accusation against another, and asking for a response. Why couldnât Muir and Raddatz come up with their own accusations? And while there were current issues that could have been raised for discussion at some length â the Flint, Mich., water crisis, for example â the moderators reached for a different kind of water issue: the use of waterboarding. <br /></p>","<p>All this did was provide Trump an occasion to puff up and deliver a bellicose, âIâd bring back waterboarding, and Iâd being back a helluva lot <i>worse</i> than waterboarding!â This was moderating in a manner that enlightened no one.<br /></p>","<p>By any measure, youâd have to say that John Kasich, Christie, and Bush helped themselves the most this night, launching pointed rejoinders at frontrunners Trump, Cruz, and Rubio, garnering more spontaneous applause than those three governors have attracted in any debate to date. By the end, as the candidates milled around the stage hugging their relatives and signing autographs, Rubio looked a bit dazed, as though heâd been sucker-punched. Thus the debate began in confusion and ended in bafflement.<br /></p>"]},"property":"tv","images":[{"caption":"Republican Debate Turns Into a Live Saturday Night Fight","id":"92606f11-ff15-3dce-b266-f23d5acb7bc8","title":"Republican Debate Turns Into a Live Saturday Night Fight","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Republican Debate Turns Into a Live Saturday Night Fight","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/EWz8axW61K80khZ7Xd3Vwg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/9ca3a83f752690c4aa6359eedfbcd61b","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"Donald Trump is still deciding whether or not he&#39;ll show up to the Republican debate on Thursday because it&#39;s being moderated by Megyn Kelly.

Â </p>","<p>Davidâs recent run as Sanders â culminating in his first-ever hosting gig â represents his grand return to <i>SNL</i>, a show he famously toiled on for a single season as a writer in the â80s, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/tv/39-saturday-night-live-39-tbt-a-1357488810655798.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">getting only a solitary sketch on the air</a>. (So the legend goes, he actually quit the show following his first episode, only to return to work a few days later with nary a comment â an experience he appropriated for a famous <i>Seinfeld </i>episode.) But time, not to mention the success of <i>Seinfeld </i>and <i>Curb</i>, has clearly healed any of those decades-old wounds. In fact, David semi-jokingly blamed himself for not clicking with <i>SNL </i>the first time around. âI auditioned for this show many, many years ago, and I was terrible,â he remarked in his suitably cantankerous monologue. âThose were the days, when I was just a poor schmuck. As opposed to now â now Iâm a rich prick!â</p>","<p>The 68-year-old comedian also warned the audience that, despite their initial excitement at spending time in this particular rich prickâs company, theyâll likely end up disappointed. âThatâs what I do â I disappoint people.â He wouldnât even promise that they had a great show in store. âWhy raise expectations? What I should be saying is the show is so-so, and if itâs good you can be surprised.â Turns out he was right to warn us: as an episode of <i>The Bernie & Larry Show</i>, the show was stellar. As an episode of <i>SNL</i>, it was totally so-so.Â </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p><b>Best <i>Bernie & Larry Show </i>Sketch: </b>âBern Your Enthusiasmâ</p>","<figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"yahoo\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fscreen.yahoo.com%2Fbern-enthusiasm-095931225.html%3Fformat%3Dembed\">\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/bern-enthusiasm-095931225.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>","<p>We all knew this was coming, but it didnât make it any less funny.

Marco Rubio of Florida, shook his hand and offered some customary words of encouragement. </p>","<p>Rubio stared mutely back, looking flummoxed, Christie told close aides moments later, according to one Christie adviser who was in the room. </p>","<p>Christie and his team were buoyant after the New Jersey governor <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/chris-christies-attacks-rattle-marco-rubio-023817040.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">mauled Rubio in a one-on-one face-off</a> in the first half-hour of the debate, repeatedly mocking Rubio for what he called his lack of experience and accomplishments.

The question now is: Who benefits from the fallout?</p>","<p>Rubio came into the debate with momentum, following a surprisingly strong third-place finish at the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. But he got in trouble Saturday starting with the very first question that came his way, which was about âreadiness to be president.â The senator, who said he was âproudâ of his record, then attempted to shift the discussion to President Barack Obama. </p>","<p>âLetâs dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnât know what heâs doing. He knows exactly what heâs doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world,â Rubio said.</p>","<p>The moderators then turned to Christie to ask about his criticisms of Rubioâs experience. When Christie doubled down, Rubio returned to his line about Obama three more times. He kept repeating the comment even as Christie mocked him for resorting to a âmemorizedâ sound bite. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p><b><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/8th-gop-debate-042401499.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Slideshow: The 8th GOP debate >>></a></b><br /></p>","<p>âI want the people at home to think about this. Thatâs what Washington, D.C., does,â Christie said of Rubio. âThe drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information, and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him.âÂ <br /></p>","<p>In the spin room afterward, Rubioâs communications director, Alex Conant, denied that the comments about Obama were scripted.</p>","<p>âEverywhere that Marco goes, he focuses on Barack Obama and uniting the country,â Conant told Yahoo News, adding, âI mean, you werenât allowed notes in that debate.â</p>","<p>Rubioâs aides in the spin room argued that he had put on a strong performance, despite the attacks from Christie.

Â </p>","<p>âEvery other campaign said before this debate started that they had one singular goal, which was to take out Marco Rubio. They threw their best shots, and they didnât do it,â Harris said.Â âThere was a big rough-and-tumble at the start, Marco got stronger every single minute, and by the end of the debate, we raised more money during this debate than weâve raised during any other debate.â<br /></p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/BTqnvlv_kTvkekxVUNx07w--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/c79530558070d5910c7f6ab24eaedf6c/tumblr_inline_o26g4oTlB01tedrp5_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"426.41300039635354\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>New Jersey Gov.

Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Christie. Each of these three finished behind Rubio in Iowa. Harris said Rubioâs team particularly expected Christie to take aim at the senator during the debate.Â </p>","<p>âChris Christie said, âMy goal is to take Marco out,â because he has to, because heâs running on fumes, because heâs on life support,â Harris said. âThis was his one chance to inflict mortal damage on Marco Rubio. He took his best shot, and he failed.â<br /></p>","<p>Backers of Kasich, who is hoping to benefit from the support of independent voters here Tuesday, said Christieâs attacks on Rubio would hopefully benefit their candidate.Â </p>","<p>\"I thought it was tough for both of them. I think any time you go negative, there are a certain number of voters who donât react well to that, and I think the attacks on Rubio probably take some toll,â said Kasich adviser Bob Walker, a former congressman from Pennsylvania. âNegative campaigning works. But weâre focused on saying thereâs a positive way of approaching presidential elections, and we think thatâs actually a winning agenda.â<br /></p>","<p>Christie finished in 10th place in Iowa, but his allies have predicted he will be <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/this-is-chris-christies-plan-for-the-primary-143922387.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">one of âfour or fiveâ candidates to emerge from New Hampshire</a>. Christieâs senior strategist Mike DuHaime told Yahoo News that Rubio had unquestionably had aÂ âbadâ night.</p>","<p>âIt was comical how many times he repeated himself,â DuHaime said of Rubio. âWhen you get accused of saying the same speech over and over again and your response is to say the same speech over and over again â it was pretty laughable. So, you know, it was a bad â it was a really bad performance. I donât think anybody can say it was anything but a really bad performance for Marco Rubio tonight. Heâs usually a very good debater, so the standards are high, but it was a bad performance tonight.â</p>","<p>Yahoo News attempted to get another contender, Donald Trump, to weigh in on Rubio.

<p><strong>\"Marshawn Lynch has a lot of money,\" Rapoport said. \"He hasn't spent a dime of his actual playing money ... ever.\"</strong></p> <p><span>Presumably, Lynch has been living the last nine

The Superior Court panel deliberated less than an hour before finding that Kent Easter of Irvine and his ex-wife, Jill Easter, acted with malice, oppression or fraud, the Orange County Register reported (http://bit.ly/1Rd9pjw ).</p>","<p>Kent Easter declared bankruptcy before the civil trial but such protection doesn't extend to the lawsuit damages, said Rob Marcereau, Peters' attorney.</p>","<p>Authorities said the Easters had an ongoing feud with Peters that started with a comment she made about their 7-year-old son when they planted prescription painkillers, marijuana and a pot pipe in Peters' car in 2011. They then called police, who briefly detained her at Plaza Vista School in Irvine, where she volunteered.</p>","<p>Peters testified that she was humiliated as a police officer searched the car as her own daughter watched.</p>","<p>\"I was crying and begging for him to not put the drugs on the car, because people would see it,\" Peters said. \"Everybody was looking at me.\"</p>","<p>She was questioned for about two hours.</p>","<p>Kent Easter, representing himself during the case, argued that Peters was exaggerating her distress in order to reap a financial reward.</p>","<p>\"The fact that something really bad was done to a person does not give them a winning Powerball number,\" he told the jury.</p>","<p>Easter declined comment after the verdict and Jill Easter, who also represented herself, was not present in court for the verdict, the Register said.</p>","<p>Peters said the Easters have never shown remorse for their action.</p>","<p>\"This was really not about money, this was about standing up to people that pick on other people and telling them it's not OK to do this,\" she said, wiping away tears. \"I wouldn't have gone this far had they said they were sorry,\" Peters said.</p>","<p>In 2014, Kent Easter was convicted of felony false imprisonment. He spent 87 days in jail. Jill Easter pleaded guilty to the same charge and spent about 60 days behind bars.</p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"news","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"def0ed47-4101-3f88-a0c9-47836eb68b51","licensed":"true","title":"A Stanford professor says eliminating 2 phrases from your vocabulary can make you more successful","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/stanford-professor-says-eliminating-2-153500571.html","summary":"The way you speak not only affects how others perceive you; it also has the potential to shape...","entities":"WIKIID:Stanford_University","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000742","publisher":"Business Insider","author":"Shana Lebowitz","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/eLrVyJi4LBxuWmw5_zATNA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE-/http://media.zenfs.com/284/2011/06/08/biz-insider-65x27_102440.gif","provider_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/","site":"finance","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"1183318087","propertyRegion":"YPROP:finance","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"1183318087","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Stanford_University\" rs=\"lmsid:a0770000003N6b9AAC;revsp:businessinsider.com;lpstaid:def0ed47-4101-3f88-a0c9-47836eb68b51\"","site":"finance","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"embedded_images":{"source":"http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/A_Stanford_professor_says_eliminating-73c45c995a493b086e5e5ed869f9a655"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"Sat, Feb 6 7:35 AM PST","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo Finance","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000742","score":"0.959239","label":"Science, Social Science, & Humanities"}],"leadItem":true,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"KonaFilter image-container display-table float_right\"><span><span class=\"image on-image\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/Jyymmm_eJ6aJvV8fKuLE8w--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/A_Stanford_professor_says_eliminating-73c45c995a493b086e5e5ed869f9a655\" class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" alt=\"woman speaking work\" data-mce-source=\"Francisco Osorio/Flickr\" data-link=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/francisco_osorio/8674005024/in/album-72157632633067987/\" width=\"640\" height=\"480.4923076923077\" /></span><span class=\"source\">(Francisco Osorio/Flickr) <br /></span><span class=\"caption\">Your language shapes the way you approach your goals. <br /> <br /></span></span></span></span></span> <p class=\"p1\">The way you speak not only affects how others perceive you; it also has the potential to shape your behavior.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Swapping one word for another could make all the difference in how you approach your goals.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That's according to Bernard Roth, a professor of engineering at Stanford and the academic director of Stanford's Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, the d.school.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In his new book, \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Achievement-Habit-Wishing-Command/dp/0062356100?tag=bisafetynet-20\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">The Achievement Habit</a>,\" Roth suggests several linguistic tweaks that can make you more successful. Here are two of the easiest:</span></p> <h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>1. Swap 'but' for 'and'</strong></span></h2> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You might be tempted to say, \"I want to go to the movies, <em>but</em> I have work to do.\"</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Instead, Roth suggests saying, \"I want to go to the movies,Â <em>and</em> I have work to do.\"</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He writes: \"When you use the word <em>but</em>, you create a conflict (and sometimes a reason) for yourself that does not really exist.\" In other words, it's possible to go to the movies as well as do your work â you just need to find a solution.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Meanwhile, when you use the wordÂ <em>and</em>, \"your brain gets to consider how it can deal with both parts of the sentence,\" Roth writes. Maybe you'll see a shorter movie; maybe you'll delegate some of your work.</span></p> <h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>2. Swap 'have to' for 'want to'</strong></span></h2> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Roth recommends a simple exercise: The next few times you say \"I have to\" in your mind, change <em>have</em> to <em>want</em>.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"This exercise is very effective in getting people to realize that what they do in their lives â even the things they find unpleasant â are in fact what they have chosen,\" he says.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, one of Roth's students felt he <em>had</em> to take the math courses required for his graduate program, even though he hated them. At some point after completing the exercise, he realized that he really did <em>want</em> to take the classes because the benefit of completing the requirement outweighed the discomfort of sitting through classes he didn't enjoy.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Both of these tweaks are based on a key component of a problem-solving strategy called \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/stanford-professor-design-thinking-achieve-your-goals-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">design thinking</a>.\" When you employ this strategy, you try to challenge your automatic thinking and see things as they really are.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And when you experiment with different language, you may realize that a problem isn't as unsolvable as it seems, and that you have more control over your life than you previously believed.</span></p> <p>NOW WATCH: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/key-to-being-confident-powerful-amy-cuddy-presence-2016-1\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">A Harvard psychologist says this is key to being more confident and powerful</a></p><br /><br /><b>More From Business Insider </b><br />\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/stanford-professor-gun-test-to-make-big-decisions-2016-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">A Stanford professor says the 'gun test' can help you make big decisions</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/a-stanford-scientist-says-self-compassion-can-make-you-more-successful-2016-1\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">A Stanford scientist says a simple psychological shift can make you more successful</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/a-trick-to-resist-temptation-and-achieve-your-goals-2016-1\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Saying these 2 words can help you be more successful</a><br /></li>\n  </ul></p> </p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"video","is_eligible":"true","id":"a90e2445-0021-3b39-8eb0-06c44918dcc8","title":"3 people died in fiery crash after hitting San Francisco taxi","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/video/3-people-died-fiery-crash-091049702.html","image_assets":[{"width":"1280","height":"720","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eVdjkxJe5iu2dZN1Gyl7PQ--/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/video/video.kgo.abc.news.com/aacb35afd2da2cb5dc025eddcba4482a","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"640","height":"360","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8wmTjYQFw5PknlNcKG173Q--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/video/video.kgo.abc.news.com/aacb35afd2da2cb5dc025eddcba4482a","tag":"img:640x?"}],"summary":"CHP officers in San Francisco tried to pull over a car doing donuts, there was a short pursuit, but it ended before the vehicle ran red lights and crashed into a taxi.","entities":"WIKIID:San_Francisco","categories":"YCT:001000992","publisher":"KGO â San Francisco","provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/SgsfdeHSP0FabCM1F_ALfA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://l.yimg.com/os/152/2012/10/25/kgo-44x70-png_145514.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/index","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"84397933","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"84397933","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"San_Francisco\" ctopid=\"1106000\" hashtag=\"1106000\" rs=\"lmsid:a097000000VKQUqAAP;revsp:video.kgo.abc.news.com;lpstaid:a90e2445-0021-3b39-8eb0-06c44918dcc8\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"duration":"0:01:45","hosted":true,"publicationDate":"3 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo -

Libras, Capricorns and other Aries are the best signs for you to hookup with, but for long-term relationships go for a Gemini, Leo, Sagittarius or Aquarius, since Scorpios will find your flirting style too in-your-face.</p>","<p><b>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</b></p>","<p>Youâre so sweet, your flirting style is like an old-fashioned Rom-Com. You prefer if someone comes on to you. Youâre also very sensual and <a href=\"http://blog.californiapsychics.com/blog/2010/02/flirting-by-sign.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">have your signature move</a> of lightly touching the palm. If youâre looking for a casual encounter, Scorpio, Aries or Virgos for you. If you want a more lasting relationship, go for a Capricorn, Libra or Gemini.</p>","<p><b>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</b></p>","<p>Your way with words is a seduction all to itself, and you use those powers to flirt in a very communicative manner, which <a href=\"http://zodiac--signs.tumblr.com/post/31458339294\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">may include wit</a> or body language. You can get bored and run very hot and cold, but it works for you because youâre also somewhat of a tease. If you just want to Netflix and chill then Leos, Virgos and Scorpios will be receptive. If youâre looking for someone to be in a relationship with, you need to find a Libra, Aries or Aquarius.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p><b>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</b></p>","<p>Your flirting style is very captivating on one hand and very nurturing on the other. Youâre genuinely interested in having people tell you about their horrible breakup or how crappy their day was. You arenât trying to flirt per se, but it makes you kind of irresistible as you connect with others on a very emotional level.</p>","<p>If you want to turn your bitch session into more of a sex session, look to Leo, Pisces or Capricorn. But letâs be honest, youâre not really that interested in a booty call. You want a life-long partner. Youâll be more likely to find it with a Taurus, Virgo or Pisces.</p>","<p><b>Leo (July 23 - August 22)</b></p>","<p>Stroking the ego isnât a one-way transaction for you. <a href=\"http://www.sunsigns.org/leo-sexuality/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">You want to get praise</a> and attention as much as you want to give it. Youâve got a whole bag of flirting moves â everything from very focused eye contact, smiling, and charisma. Youâve got sexy down to a science.</p>","<p><b>Virgo (August 23 - September 22)</b></p>","<p>Youâre the Ruler of Mixed Messages. One minute youâre reserved and standoffish, and the next youâre giving off a strong sex vibe. You donât let random people enter your exclusive circle of admirers. You use your intelligence, sexuality and a lot of tilting of the head with partially closed eyes to flirt.</p>","<p>Youâre not one for a Craigslist hookup, and if itâs casual sex youâre looking for youâll usually get it with someone you know whoâs a Gemini, Scorpio or Aquarius. When youâre at that point where you want a relationship that will go the distance, the type of person you should seek will be a Taurus, Cancer, Capricorn, or a fellow perfectionist Virgo like yourself.</p>","<p><b>Libra (September 23 - October 22)</b></p>","<p>Your sign is ruled by Venus so you know a little bit about flirting, love, and romantic gestures. Youâre a natural born flirt and use your flirting tricks such as your charm, charisma, and beauty. Since you donât want anyone to feel bad or have any conflict, you flirt with just about everybody.</p>","<p>If youâre looking for no-stings-attached fun, then go for a Taurus, another Libra, or an Aries. If youâre ready to settle down, youâll find that the most suitable partner will be a Gemini, Leo or Aquarius.</p>","<p><b>Scorpio (October 23 - November 21)</b></p>","<p>Youâre the Master of Flirting with your intense sexuality, sensitivity, and suggestive naughtiness. You enjoy flirting so much that there doesnât even need to be an endgame; itâs just fun to give someone a sultry glance, a sexy smile, and a seductive touch. If you want to give someone the one-night-stand of a lifetime, choose a Taurus, Sagittarius or Aries. When youâre looking for a significant other, then a Pisces, Cancer or a Capricorn will fit the bill.</p>","<p><b>Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21)</b></p>","<p>You love adventure, change, and have a fun, flirty style. Youâre always ready to tell a fascinating, provocative, and spectacular story, and your sense of fun is contagious and attractive. You have a talent for teasing but will deliver with some spontaneous yet sensual touching. Since youâre always ready to pick up and go, you can be a little emotionally detached sometimes, leaving the objects of your flirtation confused and hurt.</p>","<p>If you want to burn off some sexual tension, then another Sagittarius or a Scorpio would be your best partner. If you truly think you can make an emotional commitment and mean it, then find a Libra, Gemini or Leo.</p>","<p><b>Capricorn (December 22 - January 19)</b></p>","<p>You have a very sincere and straightforward flirting style. Youâre very real, but sometimes a little reserved. You make people want to find out whatâs behind your calm, cool, and collected facade. You wonât flirt with anyone you donât find interesting, and when you do flirt youâll stroke your hair or lightly touch your own body, as if to say that youâre totally ready.</p>","<p>If you want something casual then find an Aries, Cancer or Libra. For a relationship that can build, youâll want to find a partner thatâs a Taurus, Scorpio or Virgo.</p>","<p><b>Aquarius (January 20 - February 18)</b></p>","<p>You love to flirt because it shows how charismatic you are. You donât need to be one-on-one to flirt; you can flirt with an entire group with your brilliance, wicked sense of humor, and passion. You like to surprise people and keep them off-guard with your flirting.</p>","<p>If youâre feeling like having a casual encounter, then find yourself a Scorpio, Pisces or Leo. If you find yourself ready for a long-term commitment, then a Gemini, Libra or Sagittarius is best.</p>","<p><b>Pisces (February 19 - March 20)</b></p>","<p>When it comes to flirting, itâs difficult to know where the fantasy ends and the real you begins. Youâre often shy, so trying on a different persona to flirt works for you. Even if you donât say one word, people notice and gravitate to you. Youâre like some kind of magical magnet: mysterious, sensual, and sensitive.</p>","<p>If you want something casual, go for a Taurus, Libra or Aquarius. For someone compatible that will join you in your mystical travels for eternity, youâll find your cosmic cohort in a Cancer, Scorpio or Capricorn.</p>","<p><i><b>More from <a href=\"http://www.yourtango.com/2015283615/your-flirting-style-according-to-your-zodiac-sign\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">YourTango</a>:<br /><a href=\"http://www.yourtango.com/2014232483/12-sex-positions-fitting-each-zodiac-sign\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">12 Crazy Sex Positions By Zodiac Sign</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.yourtango.com/2015282786/how-you-will-die-according-to-your-zodiac-sign\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">How You Will Die, According To Your Zodiac Sign</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.yourtango.com/2015277121/what-your-zodiac-sign-says-about-the-way-you-love\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">What Your Zodiac Sign Says About The Way You Love</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.yourtango.com/2015282546/what-you-fear-most-according-to-your-zodiac-sign\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">What You Secretly Fear Most, According To Your Zodiac Sign</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.yourtango.com/2015283170/how-loyal-you-really-are-according-to-your-zodiac-sign\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">How Loyal You REALLY Are, According To Your Zodiac Sign</a></b></i></p>"]},"property":"style","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"5df3d469-1c9c-3cc8-b1d8-d309f94c9c84","licensed":"true","title":"Low pay forces South Dakota teachers to hold 2nd, 3rd jobs","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/low-pay-forces-south-dakota-teachers-hold-2nd-153813416.html","summary":"SIOUX FALLS, S.D.

There's no time to head home or step out for dinner; a chicken breast reheated in the microwave will have to suffice.</p>","<p>\"I don't get home until 9 p.m. those nights,\" said Ries, 26. \"That's twice a week, and then I work weekends.\"</p>","<p>Second and even third jobs are the norm for many school teachers in South Dakota, where teacher pay ranks lowest in the nation, according to a state education task force. Gov. Dennis Daugaard has proposed a half-cent sales tax increase to help raise teacher pay, but his plan needs two-thirds approval in both the House and the Senate â a tough proposition in a legislature with an anti-tax lean.</p>","<p>Mary McCorkle, president of the South Dakota Education Association, said teachers often give up their evenings by grading papers and preparing lessons, and second jobs lead to burnout.</p>","<p>\"Something has to give, whether it's your health, your sanity,\" McCorkle said. \"You just can't do everything, and you want to be there for your students.\"</p>","<p>The SDEA, which represents more than 5,000 teachers in the state, said Daugaard's proposal is an acknowledgement that South Dakota schools are having trouble hiring and keeping teachers.</p>","<p>The Brookings School District used to get dozens of applications for each open teaching position but now receives resumes from just a handful of qualified candidates, said school board President Steve Bayer. The pool depth is likely dwindling as applicants look across South Dakota's eastern border to better-paying jobs.</p>","<p>\"When you can make another thousand dollars a month as an experienced teacher, it's probably worth looking at a place in Minnesota,\" he said.</p>","<p>South Dakota's average teacher salary of $40,023 in 2013-14 lagged an average of six states that border it by $11,888 a year and was $8,643 behind the next lowest neighbor, North Dakota, the group found. In some of South Dakota's more remote areas, that average salary drops quickly.</p>","<p>Lori Brandt, 54, has been teaching in Big Stone for 31 years, yet the sixth- to eighth-grade reading and English teacher makes just $42,000. To get by, she pulls night and weekend desk shifts at a Super 8 motel, and doesn't get home some weeknights until 11 p.m.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Her three grown children graduated from Lake Area Technical Institute, with one son working in maintenance at a cheese factory, another son working at a feedlot and a daughter working as an agriculture manager.</p>","<p>\"They all started jobs where they're making more money starting than what I make having taught for that many years,\" Brandt said.</p>","<p>Daugaard has proposed boosting average pay by 21 percent to $48,500 per year, relying on a sales tax increase that the House's top Republican has already called unlikely. Majority Leader Brian Gosch said he was working to come up with a plan to raise pay without raising taxes, suggesting schools could dip into reserves or that state aid could be increased.</p>","<p>Teachers across the state say they hear a standard pushback line when the issue of low salaries is raised: They work just nine months of the year.</p>","<p>Jared Baumann, an eighth-grade science teacher at Patrick Henry Middle School in Sioux Falls, says that's not reality. He spends his summers working more than 40 hours a week for a Sioux Falls moving company, and during the school year puts in two or three Saturdays a month doing the same work.</p>","<p>Baumann sees his fellow University of Northern Iowa alum making twice what he makes in marketing, sales and business.</p>","<p>\"I can't buy the house they just bought,\" he said. \"I can't afford to take my family on the vacation that they just went on.\"</p>","<p>Ries, who also works as an assistant soccer coach at Augustana University in the fall, said she needs multiple jobs to pay down student loans and pursue the master's degree that could someday boost her $36,000 salary. Ries and her husband, Tom, would like to have a child, but they want to be in a better financial situation before taking that step.</p>","<p>\"We're not people who spend money on super nice things and then don't have enough money to pay our bills,\" she said. \"We don't have enough money to just live, not live out of our means.\"</p>","<p>___</p>","<p>Associated Press writer James Nord contributed to this report from Pierre.</p>","<p>___</p>","<p>Follow Dirk Lammers on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ddlammers</p>"]},"property":"news","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","height":453,"width":640,"ratio":71,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/JfB5WIZLbXEk0dquc6mMbg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0xO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/d7a2aadde491c7068f0f6a706700a9c0.jpg","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/hsR4uCHELLiVvrYNop2LrA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/d7a2aadde491c7068f0f6a706700a9c0.jpg","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[{"caption":"In this Feb. 4, 2016, photo, teacher Jessica Ries passes out writing assessment tests to her fourth-grade students at Hayward Elementary School in Sioux Falls, S.D.

Earlier this week, crude prices again dipped below $30 a barrel on worries about continuing supply glut and falling global demand. It seems very unlikely that leading oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia will be able to arrive at any agreement to cut production. Â Iranâs re-entry into an already oversupplied market further complicates the situation.<br /> <br /> Many investors have been shorting oil to profit from the continued slide in prices, but there are other investors who believe that this may be a great opportunity to invest in oil for longer-term.Â  They believe that investing in oil at current levels is ultimately going to reap tremendous benefits when oil prices rebound eventually. (Read: More Pain for Energy ETFs Post Exxon, Chevron Results)<br /> <br /> I believe that oil prices are going to stay lower for longer and this is not the time to go long on oil ETFs but timing the oil market is not easy and if you have a high risk tolerance and long-term investing horizon then probably sometime in the coming weeks or months you could start looking at oil ETFs.On the other hand, if you want to make some money from the crash in oil prices or want to hedge any energy position that you already have, then take a look at inverse oil ETPs.<br /> <br /> <strong>Inverse Oil ETPs</strong></span></span></p>","<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> <strong>Ticker</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> <strong>Exposure</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> <strong>Expense Ratio</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> <strong>ETF or ETN</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> <strong>Assets</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> <strong>YTD Return</strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> DWTI</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> <strong>3x Inverse Crude oil futures</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> 1.35%</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> ETN</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> $393.27 mil</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> 33.31%</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> DTO</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> 2x a benchmark of crude oil futures contracts</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> 0.75%</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> ETN</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> $150.76 mil</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> 39.83%</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> SZO</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> 1x inverse exposure to crude oil</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> 0.75%</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> ETN</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> $22..14 mil</td> \n   <td style=\"width:104px;height:43px;\"> 20.69%</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table>"," Â  ","<p> <span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Investors should remember most Inverse and leveraged ETFs are designed to provide their stated exposure for one day and if used for longer than a day, their performance can vary greatly from their stated objectives, due to compounding effects.<br /> <br /> In very volatile markets, these ETFs could produce much worse than expected results.

In my view, energy equity ETFs are safer options for long-term investors.
