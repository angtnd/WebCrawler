Her campaign argued that a one-two punch in the North and the South would reinforce the former secretary of stateâs strength with minority voters, while also proving that she can win in precisely the sort of big, blue-collar, non-Southern states that will define the rest of the Democratic primary calendar. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Mississippi, where nearly two-thirds of the primary voters were black, played to type, awarding Clinton a huge 83 percent to 16 percent win. Michigan, however, defied expectations, and the polls.<br /></p>","<p> With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Sanders was edging out Clinton by two percentage points, 50 percent to 48 percent.

(Photo: Tony Dejak/Associated Press)</i><br /></p>","<p>The Sanders campaign fought hard for its win. Sandersâ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, recently called the Michigan primary âa critical showdown,â and Sanders visited again and again over the last week. In a debate and a town hall, and on the stump in East Lansing, Kalamazoo, Dearborn and Ann Arbor, Sanders argued that he was a better fit than the former first lady for working-class Michiganders. He continued to criticize Clintonâs ties to Wall Street and to insist that she release the transcripts of her paid speeches to big banks. He even added a regional twist to his repertoire, hammering Hillary over her husbandâs support, as president, for the âdisastrousâ North American Free Trade Agreement, which many Michiganders blame for decades of manufacturing job losses. </p>","<p> Clinton was, as usual, ready with a riposte. During the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/us/politics/transcript-democratic-presidential-debate.html?_r=0\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">March 6 CNN debate</a> in Flint, she accused Sanders of âbeing against the auto bailoutâ â the program widely credited with saving the largest industry in the region in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. </p>","<p> âIn January of 2009, President-elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout,â Clinton said. âThe money was there and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and 4 million jobs and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry.â</p>","<p> But it wasnât enough. (Perhaps becauseÂ <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/03/truth_squad_clinton_fouls_sand.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">it wasnât quite true</a>;Â Sanders supported rescuing the auto industry, but voted against a bill that coupled it with a bailout for big banks.)Â <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/mi/Dem\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">According to the exit polls</a>, Sanders continued to rack up huge margins in Michigan among the voters who have been fueling his candidacy all along. He won voters under 30 by 63 points. He won men by 12 points. He won whites by 16 points. He won independents by 43 points. He won voters who value honesty above all else by 61 points. And so on. </p>","<p> Yet, more tellingly, Sanders also held his own among demographic groups that Clinton dominated in her 2008 battle against Barack Obama â demographic groups that could prove crucial in the contests ahead. He won white women by five points. He won whites without a college degree by 17 points. He won voters who make less than $50,000 a year by five points. He won voters who think that trade with other countries âtakes away U.S. jobsâ by 17 points. He even won union voters (by two points). And he lost the black vote by a much smaller margin than he has in the South. </p>","<figure width=\"3500\" height=\"2375\" class=\"tmblr-full\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/J6ADDkrr80hJeYaA8uQA0A--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NDgwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://36.media.tumblr.com/ff8bce35f4d79ecb48c24401b055a34e/tumblr_inline_o3rdqhs4d01t0395p_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"203.57142857142858\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>A young Sanders supporter waits for him to speak at a campaign rally in Miami on Tuesday. (Photo:âCarlo Allegri/Reuters)</i><br /></p>","<p> To be sure, Clinton will emerge from Tuesdayâs primaries with the bigger net gain in delegates. Her Mississippi landslide may have been more predictable than Sandersâ nail-biter in Michigan, but it was also more profitable. The latest estimates show that while Sanders will amass 8 to 10 more delegates than Clinton in Michigan, Clinton will scoop up 25 to 28 more delegates than Sanders in Mississippi. And so Clintonâs total delegate lead will only grow once all of Tuesdayâs votes are tallied â despite Sandersâ miracle in Michigan. In the end, this is the only measure that matters. </p>","<p> Still, Clinton has more reason to worry after Michigan than she did before. On March 15, Ohio will vote; like Michigan, it will be an open primary, which means that independents, who favor Sanders, can participate. Another open primary, in Wisconsin, will follow on April 5. Then comes Pennsylvania on April 26. Clintonâs polling lead in each of these Rust Belt states is smaller than it was in Michigan; in fact, the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/wi/wisconsin_democratic_presidential_primary-3764.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> latest Wisconsin survey shows Sanders in the lead</a>. </p>","<p> Clinton is still the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination. The numbers donât lie. But if Sanders continues to raise tons of money and make unexpected inroads in Rust Belt states such as Michigan â and if Clinton canât adjust in time â it could presage a difficult general election campaign for Hillary, especially if sheâs running against Donald Trump, who also appeals to the sort of voters who boosted Bernie on Tuesday. </p>","<p> Clinton was hoping that Michigan would close the door on Sandersâ candidacy once and for all. Instead, it has only given him more reason to rage against the dying of the light. </p>"]},"property":"politics","author":"Andrew Romano","images":[{"caption":"Sanders shocks with historic upset in Michigan, but Clintonâs delegate lead still grows","id":"42fb05dc-9823-3a50-ab75-6c3a0663db18","title":"Sanders shocks with historic upset in Michigan, but Clintonâs delegate lead still grows","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Sanders shocks with historic upset in ...","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/ByyB0Dt7yXEH393CSbulqA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NzY4O2g9MjcwLjQwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAzO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/c222078be79e87e8d3a03faefb617f9a","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"Sanders shocks with historic upset in Michigan, but Clintonâs delegate lead still grows","id":"b37e0bab-91c5-3589-919a-34dd1223e2ab","title":"Sanders shocks with historic upset in Michigan, but Clintonâs delegate lead still grows","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Sanders shocks with historic upset in ...","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/2rrod4pq_WereIesRC1eOA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NzY4O2g9MjcwLjQwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAzO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/5e795dc4fbf8326710f62cfe35ad6930","alt":null},"index":2},{"caption":"Sanders shocks with historic upset in Michigan, but Clintonâs delegate lead still grows","id":"cc8bbcd5-fa14-3caf-b5c9-0544f8e104a4","title":"Sanders shocks with historic upset in Michigan, but Clintonâs delegate lead still grows","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Sanders shocks with historic upset in ...","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/ztYvdWz3AYshw2MmEZnVog--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NzY4O2g9MjcwLjQwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAzO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/15957da2eb8ec2e8c8d521c9849ce9bd","alt":null},"index":3},{"caption":"Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addresses supporters during a campaign rally in Rochester, Minnesota February 27, 2016.

Fla. â Donald Trump advanced his lead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, winning Mississippi and Michigan, the biggest states up for grabs Tuesday in the increasingly bitter GOP primary contest. Later in the evening, he also scored a victory in the Hawaii caucuses. Meanwhile, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, vying to make it a one-on-one race with Trump, won Idaho. <br /></p>","<p>Unlike last weekâs Super Tuesday contests, just 150 delegates were up for grabs Tuesday â and all were awarded proportionally, suggesting that the results would not dramatically alter the current standing of the GOP race, where Trump enjoys a healthy lead over Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.</p>","<p> But for Trump, Tuesdayâs wins were a significant psychological victory for his insurgent campaign, affirming that he retains his momentum even after days of withering attacks from rivals and members of a Republican establishment newly determined to derail his bid for the partyâs nomination. </p>","<p> âI donât think I have ever had so many horrible things said about me in one week,â Trump said at an election night press conference here. </p>","<p>Referring to an onslaught of negative ads from his rivals and super-PACs, he added, â$38 million of horrible lies. â¦ It shows you how brilliant the public is, because they knew they were lies.â </p>","<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" height=\"2261\" width=\"3500\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img height=\"193.8\" width=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/0E9rp5qieOetEuQa_BKwAw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NDgwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/5208e2bdd86cae2da97da78cd23f681d/tumblr_inline_o3r6jmoBMD1tou6vb_1280.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p>Â <i>Donald Trump speaks at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla., on Tuesday. (Photo: Joe Skipper/Reuters)</i><br /></p>","<p>In Mississippi, Trump was projected to win by double digits, in spite of a last-minute endorsement of Cruz by Phil Bryant, the stateâs governor. Exit polls showed that Trump won thanks to not only the support of early voters, but also thanks to Republicans who waited until the last minute to select their candidate. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> And in Michigan, Trump easily triumphed in a win fueled by working-class voters angry at the federal government and politicians in Washington. According to exit polls, more than half of Michigan Republicans said they wanted the next president to be âsomeone outside the political establishment.â </p>","<p> But Trumpâs victories Tuesday also came at a time when election results and polling, both nationally and in states holding primaries and caucuses, suggest he is losing at least some altitude in the race. Last Saturday, Cruz claimed victories in Kansas and Maine â states where Trump had been favored â and in recent days, the Texas senator has pulled closer in many polls. This has given hope to party members pouring millions of dollars into super-PAC ads attacking Trump that their attacks are slowly working. </p>","<p> But itâs still unclear if Cruzâs rise has been fueled by the consolidation of anti-Trump sentiment or the real estate mogulâs missteps on the campaign trail, including his off-color commentary at last weekâs GOP debate, which did not sit well with some voters. </p>","<p> During that debate, Trump boasted about the size of his genitals, refused to disclose whether heâs waffled in private about opposing illegal immigration and showed <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/republican-debate-detroit/472245/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">no ability</a> to answer detailed questions from Fox Newsâ Chris Wallace about how to reduce the budget deficit.

Mitt Romney, the partyâs 2012 nominee, has repeatedly denounced Trump as a âphonyâ and called on Republican voters to oppose him. </p>","<p> On Monday, Republicans in Florida and Michigan began receiving get-out-the-vote robocalls featuring Romney. Though Romney has not formally endorsed a candidate (and says he wonât until after March 15, when Ohio and Florida voters head to the polls), Romney robocalls in Florida urged Republicans to back Rubio, while his Michigan calls promoted Kasich.Â </p>","<p>The calls appeared to make little difference in Michigan, Romneyâs home state. They also did not seem to give the Ohio governor the momentum he desperately needs heading into his home state primary next week, where Trump leads, according to early polls, and where he plans to campaign heavily in coming days. </p>","<p> The spotlight now shifts to Florida, where Rubio is fighting to stay alive in a race where he is increasingly losing support and momentum. On Monday, Trump, who holds a double-digit lead in Florida in some polls, unveiled a rare television ad attacking Rubio, which his campaign says it will air in Florida before next weekâs primary. </p>","<p> At the same time, Cruz has suggested he will also take aim at Rubio in Florida, in hopes of driving his fellow senator out of the race. Last week, the Texas senator opened 10 campaign offices across the state, and heâs scheduled to campaign in the state in coming days, even though he has no chance of actually winning Florida. Thatâs a potentially risky strategy for Cruz, in that it has him taking away time and attention from other voting states, like North Carolina and Illinois, where he is also hoping to inch up the nomination board delegate by delegate. </p>","<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" height=\"2534\" width=\"4103\">\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img height=\"185.27906409943944\" width=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/YIgVsWHvAih9GVV7bOT2VQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NDgwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/7047f90d624e24986ad37ec6c67d875a/tumblr_inline_o3r6r8OzyY1tou6vb_1280.jpg\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Sen. Marco Rubio addresses a campaign rally in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., on Tuesday. (Photo: Gary McCullough/AP)</i><br /></p>","<p>Coming into the night, Trump had 391 delegates, Cruz had 303, Rubio had 152 and Kasich had 37. If Rubio can win his home state of Florida next Tuesday, then he, Cruz and Kasich will all have a case for staying in the race, which could lead to a contested convention in July, since no candidate would be likely to net the 1,237 delegates required to secure the nomination. </p>","<p> On Tuesday, Trump stopped short of calling on Rubio to quit the race, as he did last Saturday. But he did call on Republicans to stop trying to derail his campaign and to get behind his candidacy in order to focus the partyâs aim on Hillary Clinton this fall â even those in the party, like Romney, whom heâs sparred with. </p>","<p> âI say, letâs come together,â Trump said. âBelieve it or not, Iâm a unifier. I unify.â </p>"]},"property":"politics","images":[{"caption":"Trump romps in Michigan and Mississippi, tightening his grip on the nomination","id":"2ea8a20b-bbde-3a7a-b4be-2b4fb64cb51d","title":"Trump romps in Michigan and Mississippi, tightening his grip on the nomination","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Trump romps in Michigan and Mississippi ...","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/kZAXrq..LWPD6nJq0G12Ww--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NzY4O2g9MjcwLjQwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAzO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/07fc6e9a0e59f8b5ee6b63c6f38b85df","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"Trump romps in Michigan and Mississippi, tightening his grip on the nomination","id":"ea3bc5b7-5c8f-3389-a504-b94bd61f93cd","title":"Trump romps in Michigan and Mississippi, tightening his grip on the nomination","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Trump romps in Michigan and Mississippi ...","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/GEjN8H81744MC1ePfqZKVw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NzY4O2g9MjcwLjQwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAzO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/08e92954b8cc2f07c5991b319895c7e2","alt":null},"index":2},{"caption":"Trump romps in Michigan and Mississippi, tightening his grip on the nomination","id":"3997f37f-c371-3c18-999c-fc60b9e1f801","title":"Trump romps in Michigan and Mississippi, tightening his grip on the nomination","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Trump romps in Michigan and Mississippi ...","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/OxXSGZGU1_LHO4gSRCfSiw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NzY4O2g9MjcwLjQwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAzO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/899ce8acea8106aa30f675cd31a535b5","alt":null},"index":3}],"count":3},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"53fb1ebb-b28a-3015-b112-c36a89785579","licensed":"true","title":"Tourist âKills Swan After Pulling It Out Of A Lake For A Selfieâ","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/woman-kills-swan-after-pulling-it-from-lake-for-a-094804381.html","summary":"This time, it was a swan in Macedonia that met its unfortunate end after being dragged up from a lake by a tourist - before being left to die on a beach.

Sharapova did not indicate in her announcement Monday how often she has taken it.</p>","<p>Her lawyer, John J. Haggerty, declined to go into specifics Tuesday but said during a conference call he wanted \"to disabuse the concept that Maria took mildronate every day for 10 years because that's simply not the case.\"</p>","<p>Grindeks, the Latvian company that manufactures meldonium, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press: \"Depending on the patient's health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from four to six weeks. Treatment course can be repeated twice or thrice a year. Only physicians can follow and evaluate patient's health condition and state whether the patient should use meldonium for a longer period of time.\"</p>","<p>Haggerty said \"Maria at all times took the mildronate in accordance with the recommendations of her doctor.\" He repeatedly declined to go into specifics about Sharapova's treatment, claiming he had to adhere to the \"strict confidentiality\" of the International Tennis Federation's process. An ITF spokesman told The Associated Press, however, that the organization places no restrictions on what players and their representatives can say publicly about an ongoing case.</p>","<p>Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion, said Monday she failed a doping test at the Australian Open in January for meldonium, which became a banned substance under the World Anti-Doping Agency code this year.</p>","<p>Meldonium is a heart medicine that improves blood flow and is little-known in the U.S., but it was once common in the Soviet military.</p>","<p>The drug's inventor, Ivars Kalvins, told Latvian newspaper Diena in a 2009 interview that meldonium was given to soldiers during the 1980s, when Soviet forces were fighting in Afghanistan.</p>","<p>\"High altitudes. Oxygen deprivation. If they have to run 20 kilometers with all the gear, at the end they would get ischemia (a blood circulation condition),\" Kalvins was quoted as saying.</p>","<p>\"They were all given meldonium. They themselves were not aware they were using it. No one was being asked (if they agree to it) back then.\"</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Kalvins said meldonium was \"not doping,\" adding that it \"allows you to withstand more physical pressure, but the body still spends its spare reserves.\"</p>","<p>Sharapova said Monday she had taken meldonium for a decade following various health problems including regular sicknesses, early signs of diabetes and \"irregular\" results from echocardiography exams.</p>","<p>\"I was first given the substance back in 2006. I had several health issues going on at the time,\" she said.</p>","<p>Meldonium was banned because it aids oxygen uptake and endurance, and several athletes in various international sports have already been caught using it since it was banned Jan. 1.</p>","<p>The wave of meldonium cases has echoes of a doping scandal involving another Soviet military drug, bromantan, which was banned after being found in Russian athletes' samples at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.</p>","<p>While Grindeks has previously stated that meldonium can provide an \"improvement of work capacity of healthy people at physical and mental overloads and during rehabilitation period,\" the Latvian company said Tuesday that it believed the substance would not enhance athletes' performance in competition and might even do the opposite.</p>","<p>\"It would be reasonable to recommend them to use meldonium as a cell protector to avoid heart failure or muscle damage in case of unwanted overload,\" the company said.</p>","<p>Grindeks said that, in sports activity, the drug slows down how the body breaks down fatty acids to produce energy.</p>","<p>Grindeks did not comment when asked whether someone with the symptoms Sharapova described would be a suitable patient for meldonium. The company said it was designed for patients with chronic heart and circulation conditions, those recovering from illness or injury and people suffering with \"reduced working capacity, physical and psycho-emotional overload.\"</p>","<p>Haggerty said \"the dosage that Maria was taking was substantially less than any dosage that has been linked to potential performance-enhancing attributes.\"</p>","<p>Meldonium is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>","<p>While meldonium was put on banned list as of Jan. 1, the decision to ban it had been announced by WADA and sports organizations as early as September. Sharapova said she received an email with information on the changes in December, but did not read the information at the time.</p>","<p>The AP was able to buy vials and tablets of meldonium over the counter in Moscow on Tuesday. Accompanying documentation stated that side effects could include blood pressure changes, irregular heartbeat and skin conditions.</p>","<p>German anti-doping expert Mario Thevis, who helped to develop the test for meldonium, told the AP that testing was reliable despite meldonium's recent addition to the WADA banned list.</p>","<p>\"There is a potential of the substance to enhance performance and it has been described as a means to facilitate recovery and to enhance physical as well as mental workload capabilities,\" Thevis, a professor at the anti-doping laboratory in Cologne, Germany, said by phone. \"It can be tested as reliably as any other doping agent.\"</p>","<p>___</p>","<p>Vitnija Saldava in Tallinn, Estonia, and Rachel Cohen in New York contributed to this report.</p>"]},"property":"news","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","width":511.7238403451996,"height":"1236","ratio":67,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/ZSGaJlCSXoQ7P8CpEHpYZg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0xO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/39d36e495194900c920f6a7067006af6.jpg","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/6aPBgy0OjVQMrSarzP_YCQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7aD0zNDEuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzc7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/39d36e495194900c920f6a7067006af6.jpg","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"images":[{"caption":"A box of meldonium tablets, also known as mildronate, is photographed in Moscow, Tuesday, March 8, 2016.
