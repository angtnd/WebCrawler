None wore the air-filtering face masks that are ubiquitous in Beijing and other Chinese cities.</p>","<p>At the time the photo was taken, Beijing's air pollution index was well into the hazardous zone at about 15 times of the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.

Henson was assessed both a flagrant foul-1 for unnecessary contact and a technical foul.</p>","<p>The Grizzlies made all three free throws to cut the deficit to 88-81, but couldn't make any concerted runs due to what seemed like a combination of being shorthanded, gassed and unable to match the defensive intensity, athleticism and fresh legs of the Bucks' young bench. With Milwaukee's lead back up to 10 in the closing seconds, Henson looked to put an exclamation point on the victory by sending a Barnes layup out of bounds ... and that's when things got interesting:</p>","<span style=\"\" class=\"yui-media yui-editorial-embed\">\n <div class=\"yom-figure yom-fig-center\" style=\"left: 0px; background: #cccccc;\" id=\"ymh-player-iframe\">\n  <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><div class=\"js-video-placeholder RatioBox Bgc-x Bd-0\" data-yepConfig=\"{&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;page_space_id&quot;:&quot;2143969830&quot;,&quot;video_uuid&quot;:&quot;4fec9be2-d915-3674-a590-1ee6a8ee5b67&quot;,&quot;device&quot;:&quot;desktop&quot;,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;sports&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;startScreen&quot;:{&quot;showTitle&quot;:true,&quot;showDescription&quot;:true,&quot;showButton&quot;:true,&quot;showProvider&quot;:false},&quot;width&quot;:640}\"></div></div>\n </div></span>","<p>As soon as Henson came down after swatting Barnes' shot, he started mean-mugging the vet. Barnes, as you might expect, didn't take too kindly to that, and came over to get in Henson's face; the refs once again separated the players, and Henson held his stinkface throughout a walk off the court, toward the tunnel, back onto the court and back to the Bucks' bench. All that taunting earned him another technical foul, which meant an automatic ejection; as Henson walked to the locker room, he held his hands up in victory, exhorting the BMO Harris Bradley Center crowd before taking off his jersey and throwing it up into the stands.</p>","<p>Barnes, for his part, only received a technical, and was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FlyerGrizBlog/status/710667385028489217\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"><em>not</em> ejected</a> from the game.

After fielding and resisting some FBI requests for data, Apple was sued by the government. ItÂ asked Apple to create code to help it break into the shooterâs iPhone and potentially other phones from different cases, as well. Apple refused and openly defied a court order to do so. Cook says that the decision wasnât made on a whim or overnight, but it was something that he and other Apple leaders had discussed at length previously.</p>","<span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed alignright size-medium wp-image-936262\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/xcEpYOXtkF.OOp4TCJzTVA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MjQ0O3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/digital_trends_973/605bc665997706eb61c856fd3adcb897\" alt=\"tim-cook-time-cover\" width=\"244\" height=\"325\" /></span>","<p>âWhen we saw the government going not only to this extent, but now going to a greater degree and asking us to develop â¦ a new product that takes out all the security aspects, and makes it a simple process for them to guess many thousand different combinations of passwords or passcodes, we said you know, that case is now important,â Cook said.Â âLots of people internally were involved. It wasnât just me sitting in a room somewhere deciding that way, it was a labored decision. We thought about all the things you would think we would think about.â</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>The crux of Appleâs argument is that creating a backdoor for the FBI to access is not only dangerous, but a violation of civil liberties and American values. Cook referenced the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in his arguments.</p>","<p>âWhen I think of civil liberties I think of the founding principles of the country,â Cook began. âThe freedoms that are in the First Amendment. But also the fundamental right to privacy.â</p>","<p><strong>Related:Â </strong><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-court-filing-in-terrorist-encryption-case/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Apple picks apart FBIâs ârecklessâ and âuninformedâ argument in scathing new brief</a></p>","<p>Cook argues that removing encryption will not make Americans more secure, nor will it protect their privacy:Â âI believe that if you took privacy and you said, Iâm willing to give up all of my privacy to be secure. So you weighted it as a zero. My own view is that encryption is a much better, much better world. â¦ Â And to me it is so clear that even if you discount the importance of privacy, that encryption is the way to go.â</p>","<h3>You canât have privacy without security</h3>","<p>Another key point Cook raised during the interview, was that this case isnât about having privacy or security â itâs about having both.</p>","<p>âI know everybody wants to paint it as privacy versus security, as if you can give up one and get more of the other,â Cook said. âI think itâs very simplistic and incorrect. I donât see it that way at all.â</p>","<p>Cook believes that when you view it as an either-or issue, youâre saying that we have to trade privacy for security. And if we do that, then you may have stopped one bad guy, but âyouâve exposed 99 percent of good people.â</p>","<p>âI think itâs privacy and security or privacy and safety versus security,â he added. âItâs not that peopleâs wellbeing, their physical wellbeing is not a part of privacy. It is. It very much is.â</p>","<h3>The dangers of backdoors</h3>","<p>Cook reiterated his fears about creating a backdoor for the government, painting aÂ frightening scenario in which an anti-encryption law is passed.</p>","<p><strong>Related:Â </strong><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-ceo-opens-dialoge-on-fbi-case/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Apple CEO Tim Cook opens dialogue with the public, as victimsâ families speak out</a></p>","<p>âLetâs say you just pulled encryption. Letâs ban it. Letâs you and I ban it tomorrow. And so we sit in Congress and we say, thou shalt not have encryption. What happens then?â he asked. âWell, I would argue that the bad guys will use encryption from non-American companies, because theyâre pretty smart.â</p>","<div class=\"dtads-inject-hook\" style=\"display:none;\"></div>","<p>âSo are we really safer then? I would say no. I would say weâre less safe, because now weâve opened up all of the infrastructure for people to go wacko at.â</p>","<p>Same goes for putting in a backdoor to get at your messages or digital communication, Cook claims.Â In the case of messaging, Cook says Apple doesnât want to read or store your messages. He explained that Appleâs job is just to send the message â not to read it or store it somewhere so it can be read later.</p>","<p>âIâm the FedEx guy. Iâm taking your package and Iâm delivering it,â Cook said. âMy job isnât to open it up, make a copy of it, put it over in my cabinet in case somebody later wants to come say, âIâd like to see your messages.â Thatâs not a role that I play â¦Â No one should have a key that turns a billion locks. It shouldnât exist.â</p>","<h3>More tech equals more data and more danger</h3>","<p>Cook called the technology era âthe golden age of surveillance,â because âthere is more information about all of us, so much more than 10 years ago, or five years ago. Itâs everywhere.â</p>","<p><strong>Related:Â </strong><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-fbi-justice-department-threat/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Department of Justice threatens to take Appleâs iOS source code in San Bernardino case</a></p>","<p>He takes issue with the argument that Appleâs push for end-to-end encryption is as good as âgoing dark.â</p>","<p>âNo oneâs going dark,â he said. âI mean really, itâs fair to say that if you send me a message and itâs encrypted, itâs fair to say they canât get that without going to you or to me, unless one of us has it in our cloud at this point. Thatâs fair to say. But we shouldnât all be fixated just on whatâs not available. We should take a step back and look at the total thatâs available.â</p>","<p>âBecause thereâs a mountain of information about us. I mean thereâs so much. Anyway, Iâm not an intelligence person. But I just look at it and itâs a mountain of data.â</p>","<h3>America will do the right thing</h3>","<p>At the end of the day, Cook believes that America will do the right thing and stand up for the right to privacy and encryption.</p>","<p>âI think thereâs too much evidence to suggest that [backdoors are] bad for national security,â he said. âIt means weâre really throwing out founding principles on the side of the road.

In a wide-ranging interview published Thursday in Time magazine, Cook granted further insight into the companyâs unyielding stance on encryption, and his own. \n Far from backing off or waffling, Cook reserved his strongest statements yet for his interview, doubling down on his dedication to privacy and suggesting that the FBI&#8217;s request violates the U.S. Constitution and Americans&#8217; civil liberties. We&#8217;ve collected the most powerful and revealing quotations from the transcript, and one thing&#8217;s for sure: The Feds have aÂ formidable foe, and he&#8217;s not going anywhere. \n You can read the full interview on Time magazine right here. \n Read more:Â  Apple vs. FBI Showdown Â |Â  Apple vs. the FBI: A complete timeline of the war over tech encryption \n Apple debated the issue internally \n At the start of the interview, Cook explained how the FBI approached Apple about getting information from the San Bernardino shooter&#8217;s iPhone 5C. After fielding and resisting some FBI requests for data, Apple was sued by the government. ItÂ asked Apple to create code to help it break into the shooter&#8217;s iPhone and potentially other phones from different cases, as well. Apple refused and openly defied a court order to do so. Cook says that the decision wasn&#8217;t made on a whim or overnight, but it was something that he and other Apple leaders had discussed at length previously. \n \n &#8220;When we saw the government going not only to this extent, but now going to a greater degree and asking us to develop &#8230; a new product that takes out all the security aspects, and makes it a simple process for them to guess many thousand different combinations of passwords or passcodes, we said you know, that case is now important,&#8221; Cook said.Â &#8220;Lots of people internally were involved. It wasnât just me sitting in a room somewhere deciding that way, it was a labored decision. We thought about all the things you would think we would think about.&#8221; \n The crux of Apple&#8217;s argument is that creating a backdoor for the FBI to access is not only dangerous, but a violation of civil liberties and American values. Cook referenced the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in his arguments. \n &#8220;When I think of civil liberties I think of the founding principles of the country,&#8221; Cook began. &#8220;The freedoms that are in the First Amendment. But also the fundamental right to privacy.&#8221; \n Related:Â  Apple picks apart FBI&#8217;s &#8216;reckless&#8217; and &#8216;uninformed&#8217; argument in scathing new brief \n Cook argues that removing encryption will not make Americans more secure, nor will it protect their privacy:Â &#8220;I believe that if you took privacy and you said, Iâm willing to give up all of my privacy to be secure. So you weighted it as a zero. My own view is that encryption is a much better, much better world. &#8230; Â And to me it is so clear that even if you discount the importance of privacy, that encryption is the way to go.&#8221; \n You can&#8217;t have privacy without security \n Another key point Cook raised during the interview, was that this case isn&#8217;t about having privacy or security &#8212; it&#8217;s about having both. \n &#8220;I know everybody wants to paint it as privacy versus security, as if you can give up one and get more of the other,&#8221; Cook said. &#8220;I think itâs very simplistic and incorrect. I donât see it that way at all.&#8221; \n Cook believes that when you view it as an either-or issue, you&#8217;re saying that we have to trade privacy for security. And if we do that, then you may have stopped one bad guy, but &#8220;you&#8217;ve exposed 99 percent of good people.&#8221; \n &#8220;I think itâs privacy and security or privacy and safety versus security,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Itâs not that peopleâs wellbeing, their physical wellbeing is not a part of privacy. It is. It very much is.&#8221; \n The dangers of backdoors \n Cook reiterated his fears about creating a backdoor for the government, painting aÂ frightening scenario in which an anti-encryption law is passed. \n Related:Â  Apple CEO Tim Cook opens dialogue with the public, as victims&#8217; families speak out \n &#8220;Letâs say you just pulled encryption. Letâs ban it. Letâs you and I ban it tomorrow. And so we sit in Congress and we say, thou shalt not have encryption. What happens then?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Well, I would argue that the bad guys will use encryption from non-American companies, because theyâre pretty smart.&#8221; \n  \n &#8220;So are we really safer then? I would say no. I would say weâre less safe, because now weâve opened up all of the infrastructure for people to go wacko at.&#8221; \n Same goes for putting in a backdoor to get at your messages or digital communication, Cook claims.Â In the case of messaging, Cook says Apple doesn&#8217;t want to read or store your messages. He explained that Apple&#8217;s job is just to send the message &#8212; not to read it or store it somewhere so it can be read later. \n &#8220;Iâm the FedEx guy. Iâm taking your package and Iâm delivering it,&#8221; Cook said. &#8220;My job isnât to open it up, make a copy of it, put it over in my cabinet in case somebody later wants to come say, &#8216;Iâd like to see your messages.&#8217; Thatâs not a role that I play &#8230;Â No one should have a key that turns a billion locks. It shouldnât exist.&#8221; \n More tech equals more data and more danger \n Cook called the technology era &#8220;the golden age of surveillance,&#8221; because &#8220;there is more information about all of us, so much more than 10 years ago, or five years ago. Itâs everywhere.&#8221; \n Related:Â  Department of Justice threatens to take Apple&#8217;s iOS source code in San Bernardino case \n He takes issue with the argument that Apple&#8217;s push for end-to-end encryption is as good as &#8220;going dark.&#8221; \n &#8220;No oneâs going dark,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean really, itâs fair to say that if you send me a message and itâs encrypted, itâs fair to say they canât get that without going to you or to me, unless one of us has it in our cloud at this point. Thatâs fair to say. But we shouldnât all be fixated just on whatâs not available. We should take a step back and look at the total thatâs available.&#8221; \n &#8220;Because thereâs a mountain of information about us. I mean thereâs so much. Anyway, Iâm not an intelligence person. But I just look at it and itâs a mountain of data.&#8221; \n America will do the right thing \n At the end of the day, Cook believes that America will do the right thing and stand up for the right to privacy and encryption. \n &#8220;I think thereâs too much evidence to suggest that [backdoors are] bad for national security,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It means weâre really throwing out founding principles on the side of the road. So I think thereâs so many things to suggest that they wouldnât do that. Thatâs not something I lose sleep over. Iâm very optimistic, I have got to be, that in a debate, a public debate, all of these things will rise up and youâll see sanity take over.&#8221; \n This case has the potential to set a dangerous precedent, Cook has said, but it also has the potential to set America on the right side of history in the encryption debate. \n &#8220;Weâre going to fight the good fight not only for our customers but for the country,&#8221; Cook said. &#8220;Weâre in this bizarre position where weâre defending the civil liberties of the country against the government.

Who would have ever thought this would happen? I never expected to be in this position. The government should always be the one defending civil liberties. And thereâs a role reversal here.

We shared a home and have a child together, whom I support. She has primary custody, and I provide financial support and exercise my visitations regularly. ","<p> We broke up six months ago and she immediately moved a man into the house. Since they split up, she has done this again with a new person. <p> I have moved on and am content being single and focusing on my career and parenting my son when he's with me. Where I struggle is when these new men want to meet me. I don't feel obligated to shake their hands, be polite and friendly or be a supportive, smiling face. <p> I'm disturbed by the speed she moves into other relationships. I feel like it sets a bad example for my son regardless of how \"nice\" these men are. There is no record of abuse, and I do believe my ex is a good mother, just maybe lonely and very dependent on having companionship. <p> I understand life goes on and people move on, but at what point is this unhealthy? Am I wrong for not wanting to be friends with my ex and her new \"guy friend\" whenever she decides she should be accompanied for custody exchange? I refuse to speak to or acknowledge these men. I am not confrontational, but I literally have nothing to say. Any advice how to handle this moving forward? -- FAKING SMILES <p> DEAR FAKING SMILES: I subscribe to the philosophy that one can never have enough friends. You don't have to approve of your ex's boyfriends, but it is in your child's best interest to maintain a relationship that approximates cordiality. It won't hurt you to shake hands and be on a first-name basis with the men who occupy space in your son's life even temporarily. When we can't change something, sometimes we have to accept it -- and that's what you would be wise to do.<p> \n      <hr size=\"1\" width=\"75%\" noshade=\"\" align=\"center\">\n        DEAR ABBY: I'm sure there are many others who would like to know this: I'm trying to downsize.

I refuse to throw them in the recycling bin. Any ideas? -- JOY IN NEW YORK \n       <p> DEAR JOY: I did a quick search online to see what other people might be doing with their old encyclopedias. A solution popped up that might help you: Immigrants who are learning English as a second language may be able to use them if you offer them in a yard sale.
