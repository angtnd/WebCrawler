The investigation is being led by the Tainan District Prosecutors Office.","publisher":"Reuters"},"cover_image_assets":{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j15UEBGPjv9NNX3TC6OsXA--/aD0xMzY1O3c9MjA0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/2fdc738ae2a5be068f0f6a7067009f4c.jpg","tag":"size=original","width":"2047","height":"1365"}},{"followId":"32ea2bcc-8493-11e5-9e54-fa163e6f4a7e","name":"Marco Rubio campaign","status":"open","upsell":"true","stream_items":{"xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","type":"article","is_eligible":"true","id":"ff3d14b2-c607-30b6-ad68-e03fa15488dc","cluster_id":"32ea2bcc-8493-11e5-9e54-fa163e6f4a7e","licensed":"true","title":"Rubio needs strong New Hampshire showing to rebut debate critics","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/rubio-needs-strong-hampshire-showing-rebut-debate-critics-110213993.html","image_assets":[{"width":"450","height":"333","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6a7lZ_KYcDkJ0Nez2LceQg--/aD0zMzM7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-133147081.jpeg","tag":"size=original"},{"width":"100","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c4tfQbjaSXJxE9LaCSyuiA--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-133147081.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=square"},{"width":"178","height":"100","url":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZZDd1GhxR4gRTA_Mpemn_A--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEwMDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MTc4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://spn.zenfs.com/gondor/gondor-133147081.jpeg","tag":"pc:size=small_fixed"}],"published":"2016-02-09T15:42:54Z","summary":"By James Oliphant MANCHESTER, N.H.

This could be Ken Burnsâ next miniseries.</p>","<p>After holding satellite camps below the Mason-Dixon Line last summer, Harbaugh has finalized invasion plans for the next strategic objective: Bradenton, Fla., home of IMG Academy and many fine young football players Harbaugh undoubtedly would like to see one day wearing Michigan maize and blue. Thatâs where the Wolverines will hold a week of their spring football practices during the schoolâs spring break, an audacious burst of Northern aggression that created a ripple of unease in the Southeastern Conference office.</p>","<p>In the role of Confederate general Joseph Johnston, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey is attempting to halt Harbaughâs flanking maneuvers. Sankey voiced his concern to Dennis Dodd of CBSSports.com earlier this week: âLetâs draw a line and say, âThatâs not appropriate.â â He said he will ask the NCAA Football Oversight Committee to prohibit spring practice during spring break.</p>","<p>Sankey cited a hot-button issue of late: time athletes are spending on their sport. That was a topic of extensive discussion at the January NCAA Convention, and <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/15/time-demands-focus-ncaa-convention-policy-changes-may-have-wait \" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">the association released student-athlete polling data</a> showing that FBS football players were spending 42 hours per week on their sport. However, proposals for legislation that would limit the time demands on athletes were abruptly tabled at the convention.</p>","<p>So Sankey is not pulling that concern out of thin air â the point is whether thatâs really the concern at all. Via Twitter, Harbaugh lobbed a sub-tweet artillery shell back at Sankey on Wednesday: âQuestion of the day: Does anyone find whining to be attractive? Just curious.â<span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1455197091679\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Right\"><img title=\"Jim Harbaugh yells to players during his Summer Football Camp on June 5, 2015.

This is about saying we're not going to infringe further on the time demands of student-athletes â the free times and spring break in particular.\"</p>","<p>Sankey is smart, principled and wonkishly integral to the NCAA structure â heâs the current chairman of the Committee On Infractions, and heâs worked on the Gender-Equity Task Force. He cares about policy and the state of college sports. So I believe him when he says he is applying a student-athlete welfare perspective to the issue of invading Big Ten schools holding spring football practice in his backyard.</p>","<p>But he also brings the perspective of competitive advantage to the issue â or disadvantage, in this case. Time demands are nice window dressing. The crux of the matter is keeping Harbaugh â and anyone who may follow â from raiding the South for more elite players. SEC member schools are paying Sankey seven figures to maintain competitive hegemony, then worry about the ancillary issues.</p>","<p>So when Sankey talks about time demands, SEC coaches understand thatâs code for protecting recruiting turf.</p>","<p>And when Harbaugh talks about the educational opportunities and fun his players will experience in Florida â âWeâre going to have swim meets, weâre going to have putt-putt golf...â he told the Detroit News â what he really means is that five-star recruits everywhere should come to fun-loving Michigan.</p>","<p>Those are the brass tacks. To discuss this in other terms is typical of the artful dodging that so often comes with big-time college sports. Rarely does anyone want to admit that winning and making money are the driving forces.</p>","<p>But even if both sides are waging a recruiting war, maybe student-athlete welfare really <em>should</em> be taken into consideration here.</p>","<div align=\"center\">\n â â â â â â â â â â â â\n</div>","<p>Iâm not here to tell you that spending a week in Bradenton is a terrible burden. Especially when the players in question are coming from Ann Arbor in late February.</p>","<p>But it is one more choice that doesnât belong to the athlete. One more decision made without their input. One more encroachment on their sparse free time.</p>","<p>Consider what the average college football player at a high-level FBS program has been doing for the past eight-plus months:</p>","<p>He almost certainly spent the summer on campus, taking classes and working out. The workouts are âvoluntary,â but everyone knows who is showing up and who isnât. Coaches arenât supposed to have contact with the players while they are doing things like seven-on-seven drills, but ask yourself why most of their offices have big windows that face the stadium or practice fields.</p>","<p>Several years ago I met a college quarterback as he was coming off the field after a voluntary, no-coaches summer workout â and before I could say five words to him his position coach descended to ask him about an incorrect read he made on one play. A play the coach wasnât supposed to be watching.</p>","<p>If time allows, players may have gotten a few days to go home before August camp started. But maybe not. Thatâs an intense, weeks-long immersion that only lets up when fall semester classes start and game week arrives.<span id=\"yui_3_0_0-2-1455197091680\" class=\"yui-editorial-embed\"><span id=\"schemaorg\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c Editorial-Right\"><img title=\"Jim Harbaugh drew a slew of celebrities to Michigan's campus for the Wolverines' Signing Day Feb. 3.

Oh, and practice video will be sent to your iPad daily so you can watch that â in your spare time.</p>","<p>Thanksgiving break is a welcome respite for regular students. It doesnât exist for college football players.</p>","<p>December may entail a 13th game if your team has made a conference championship. Either way, it certainly entails studying for finals â and for some players who have gotten behind during a labor-intensive fall, those are hugely important opportunities to salvage grades.</p>","<p>After finals, the campus empties and everyone goes home for a long holiday break. But if your team is in a bowl game, youâre not going anywhere for a while. If itâs a New Yearâs bowl game, you may get a few days at home before returning either to campus or directly to the bowl site. For Michigan last season, playing in the Jan. 2 Citrus Bowl, everyone reported to Tampa on Dec. 26.</p>","<p>When the bowl is over, there finally is a chance to exhale for the remainder of the holiday break â maybe a couple of weeks. When the spring semester begins, though, so do the winter conditioning workouts.</p>","<p>A person familiar with Michiganâs winter workout regimen said players are going four to five days a week, alternating between lifting and running. Weekends are free, which does give players who live nearby the chance to go home if desired. But if not â and there were 39 players on the Michigan roster in 2015 who were not from Michigan or an adjoining state â your best chance to get home is spring break.</p>","<p>Or was. Now, thatâs a fourth vacation period â summer, Thanksgiving, holidays, spring break â that has been occupied in whole or in large part by King Football.</p>","<p>The thing is, the vast majority of athletes want to work. Theyâre driven, hungry and understand that the NCAAâs 20-hour workweek is more a minimum than a maximum. Theyâre willing to put in the extra time.</p>","<p>But the place where a lot of them balk is the offseason. For football players, spring practice tends to be more disliked (or, at best, tolerated) than enjoyed. And when spring practice takes over spring break, thatâs one more encroachment at a time when athletes could use time off.</p>","<p>Itâs true that spring practices are limited to 15 total, and no more than four hours per day. So the spring break practices are not an add-on. And as the Michigan source pointed out, starting those 15 days earlier means ending them earlier, which will give players more academic prep time for spring finals.</p>","<p>But this still takes the place of a complete separation from the sport. Because that added week on campus without spring ball will almost certainly mean more âvoluntaryâ workouts. When athletes are in town, theyâre expected to be working â thatâs the new norm.</p>","<p>At plenty of cold-weather schools, other sports schedule warm-weather training trips or competition swings as well â the Michigan swim teams spent a week during Christmas break practicing and competing in Key Largo, Fla. But the difference is, swimming is a two-semester sport that runs right through that holiday period â the Wolverines would have been in the water on campus if they werenât in Florida. Those were not offseason practices.</p>","<p>Of course, the cold-weather schools use those trips as recruiting incentives. Harbaugh will do the same with this one â come join us and spend a week in Florida!

And despite getting $1.3 million in scholarships (which covered his four years at Drexel University with the rest to be redeemed if he decides to pursue a Masterâs and PhD), Gray came out of the application process frustrated.</span></p>","<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>âThereâs all this money in the marketplace looking for students. There are students on the other side and they canât find money. And all this money gets unawarded,â Gray, 24, tells Yahoo Finance. </span></p>","<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>He thought there should be an easier way to find scholarships. So he created Scholly, a mobile and web app that instantly matches high school, college and graduate school students with scholarships they qualify for.</span></p>","<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Scholarships in Schollyâs database are both need- and merit-based. The app narrows down your search with eight parameters (e.g., your state, your GPA, your race). When making your profile, thereâs even a section titled âmiscellaneousâ in case there are other traits or qualities you may want to list, like being a vegetarian or left-handed. </span></p>","<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Of course, Scholly is not the only option for students looking for tuition help. Fastweb is an online scholarship search engine and provides career planning services for users.

Scholarships.com has awarded more than $2.7 million in financial aid since 1999, and offers an app thatâs free to download. </span></p>","<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Scholly app, which launched in 2014, has been downloaded 600,000 times and students have won over $200 million in scholarships since it officially launched a year-and-a-half ago.</span></p>","<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>At least 40% of users are students of color, according to Gray. He says resources like Scholly can help those who might otherwise not be able to afford college, in part because they donât have access to financial aid. âWhen you look at a lot of low-income students who are desperately looking for money for college, youâre looking at a lot of minorities who come from poor communities who donât have access to aid; so thatâs really been an important part of our user base,â he says. </span></p>","<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The app costs $2.99, but Gray has been teaming up with organizations that are willing to cover the cost. He developed a program called </span><a href=\"http://home.myscholly.com/give/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"><span>Give: Scholly</span></a><span>, which enables organizations and companies to purchase bulk codes and distribute them to students so they can get the app for free.

John Kasich, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.</p>","<p>At his Election Night watch party in Manchester, Trump was exultant. <span class=\"message_body\">\"New Hampshire, I want to thank you.

You started it, I want you to remember you started it.\"</span></p>","<div id=\"tt-wrapperd4f3e1d\"> \n <div class=\"mention\">\n   The result was never in doubt, as television networks called the race seconds after the final polls closed in the state at 8 p.m. Instead, the drama lay with the laggards. Ohio Gov. John Kasich prevailed in a hotly contested battle for second place, earning 16% of the vote with about 45% of precincts reporting. Trailing him in the battle for third were Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. \n </div> \n</div>","<p>The top two finishers took dramatically different paths. Trump trafficked in divisive rhetoric, making illegal immigration one of his signature issues and calling for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. He promised economically frustrated supporters that his business acumen would reverse the fortunes of a nation in decline and rode the populist message to victory despite spending relatively little time in New Hampshire.</p>","<p>Not one for the niceties of New Hampshire politics, he <a href=\"http://time.com/4212200/donald-trump-new-hampshire-retail-politics/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">mostly eschewed its tradition of small-scale retail events</a>, held megarallies halfway across the country in the race's final week and <a href=\"http://time.com/4213231/donald-trump-ted-cruz-offensive-name/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">called Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a vulgarity</a> on the eve of the election.</p>","<p>Kasich, on the other hand, practically mounted a campaign for governor of the Granite State. The Ohioan held a total of 106 town halls here, dumping nearly all of his limited resources into New Hampshire. As Trump campaigned on dark themes, Kasich was the self-styled \"prince of light and hope.\"</p>","<p>Ohio's chief executive is <a href=\"http://time.com/4214910/john-kasich-republican-new-hampshire/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">no squishy moderate</a>; he was a longtime budget hawk in Congress and as governor pushed through sweeping restrictions on public-employee unions' collective bargaining rights that were ultimately overturned in a voter referendum. But he campaigned on a message of compassionate conservatism, from improving the mental-health system to lifting voters out of poverty. He touted his decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio, in a break with party orthodoxy.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>But Kasich wanted to run a different kind of campaign. In <a href=\"http://time.com/4193192/john-kasich-donald-trump-new-hampshire/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">an interview with TIME last month on his campaign bus</a>, he warned about the roots of Trump's rise. \"I'm concerned about negativity rising in America,\" he said, passing an article comparing Trump to the know-nothings to staffers on his iPad. \"I'm concerned about people thinking we should ban all Muslims. I think it represents fear, insecurity, and we just have to have antidote.\" Kasich believes he's the medicine.<br /> <span class=\"credit\">Natalie Keyssar for TIME </span><span class=\"caption\">Republican presidential candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich attends a campaign event at Searles School and Chapel in Windham, N.H. on Feb. 8, 2016.</span></p>","<p>He faces a tougher battle in South Carolina, and in the end his finish may be less of a personal victory than a validation that the party is looking for a Trump alternative. Between Kasich, Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the party's so-called establishment lane earned some 50% of the vote in New Hampshire. Christie's sixth-place finish--which put him last among the three governors who concentrated significant resources here--will <a href=\"http://time.com/4213889/new-hampshire-primary-results-donald-trump-bernie-sanders/?10&xid=homepage\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">likely signal the end of his campaign</a>, as he will be <a href=\"http://time.com/4214206/south-carolina-debate-criteria-christie-fiorina/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">unlikely to qualify for the next GOP debate</a> on Saturday night in South Carolina.</p>","<p>On the other side, the signs of Trump's success were visible in networks' exit surveys. Republican voters expressed deep apprehension about the economy: more than 7 in 10 said it was headed in the wrong direction. Fears of terrorism have deepened, with 9 in 10 professing concern about a major terrorist attack in the U.S. Another 9 in 10 said they were dissatisfied or angry with the way the federal government is working. Nearly half of GOP voters said they felt \"betrayed\" by Republican politicians, and more (48%) said they preferred a president from outside the political establishment than the number (46%) that sought one with political experience. It's not hard to see why Trump fits that profile.</p>","<p>The old adage holds that Iowa picks corn and New Hampshire picks presidents. This year, the Granite State's role, it seems, was to extend a battle for the soul of a divided party. The emergence of Kasich and Bush, coupled with Rubio's slide after a strong third-place showing in Iowa, will extend the intramural warfare in the party's establishment bracket, which Rubio had hoped to wrap up here. Instead, the fight will drag on for at least another 10 days, with both Bush and Kasich headed to South Carolina. \"You all have reset the race,\" Bush told a modest crowd at his Election Night party in Manchester on Tuesday night.</p>","<p><span class=\"credit\">Natalie Keyssar for TIME </span><span class=\"caption\">Supporters of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush attend a town hall event at the McKelvie Intermediate School in Bedford, N.H. on Feb. 6, 2016.</span></p>","<p>The Bush campaign was quick to downplay Kasich's strong finish, despite spending $35 million in the state. Bush spokesman Tim Miller argued that Kasich \"ran a one-state campaign and we don't expect him to be a viable threat for the nomination.\" A somewhat rejuvenated Bush looms as a threat to Rubio, his onetime proteg?. Bush's well-funded super PAC and deep national organization could reassert him as a viable contender with a strong result in South Carolina, where his brother, former President George W. Bush, remains a highly popular figure. President Bush is expected to join his younger brother on the campaign trail in the Palmetto State as soon as early next week.</p>","<p>Rubio's failure to knock out his center-right rivals is also a boon to Trump and Cruz. The latter have largely unobstructed paths in their respective lanes, with Trump courting a coalition of disaffected middle-and-working-class whites drawn to his angry populist message and Cruz positioning himself as the choice for ideological conservatives. The battle between them in South Carolina--and beyond that, in the southern states that vote in the so-called SEC primary--is going to be a nasty one.</p>","<p>But for a moment on Tuesday, Kasich was able to argue that optimism had prevailed. \"C<span class=\"message_content\">learly change is in the air,\" he told supporters at his victory party in Concord. \"Maybe, just maybe, we are turning the page on a dark period in American politics. Tonight the light overcame the darkness.\"</span></p>","<p><em>This article was originally published on Time.com.</em></p>","<p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/09/why-republicans-are-more-divided-than-ever-after-new-hampshire/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">See original article on Fortune.com</a></p>","<p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/09/why-republicans-are-more-divided-than-ever-after-new-hampshire/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> <strong>More from Fortune.com</strong> </a></p>","<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/09/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-new-hampshire-primary/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Trump and Sanders Deal Major Blows to Establishment Candidates in New Hampshire</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/09/trump-gracious-in-new-hampshire-victory-speech/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Trump Gracious in New Hampshire Victory Speech</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/09/donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-take-new-hampshire/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Take New Hampshire</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/09/john-kasich-republican-new-hampshire/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">5 Things to Know About John Kasich</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/09/best-presidential-candidate-energy-companies/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Who Would Be the Best Presidential Candidate for Energy Companies?</a></li> \n</ul>","<br>","<span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nU4eQM09zSU_sDnvujNk9w--/aD0xO3c9MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fortune_175/0a0fe9e83f035202baeb7c800f92fb0c\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>"]},"property":"finance","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"3a5bfa8b-8f93-310b-ade4-d256f2901760","licensed":"true","title":"Ted Cruz Finishes Third in New Hampshire Primary","link":"https://gma.yahoo.com/ted-cruz-finishes-third-hampshire-primary-173509973.html","summary":"Sen.

Although the request was unusual, technical director Linford Rickard didn't think much of it. <br /><br />\"She was very upbeat and very friendly,\" Rickard recalls to PEOPLE about the morning of July 15, 1974. \"Everything seemed to be going fine.\" <br /><br />News director Gordon Galbraith says that Chubbuck that morning \"was in a better mood than any of the other times when she came in.\" <br /><br />Galbraith recalls that Chubbuck told him she planned to open her 30-minute community affairs show with a short newscast â something that she never normally did before her program â during which she would play a clip of a shooting. <br /><br />Chubbuck, an accomplished puppeteer in her spare time, placed a brown bag with two puppets she made under her desk. Concealed inside the bag was a .38 caliber pistol. Rickard says he noticed the bag when he checked the set but didn't think anything of it. <br /><br />\"I didn't see the gun,\" he recalls. <br /><br /><em>For more on Christine Chubbuck's shocking on-air suicide in 1974, pick up this week's issue of PEOPLE on newsstands Friday</em> <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TbnVslQutQPl1OiH2CqtsA--/aD04NTM7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/111f31147e96e7bba4581d6342b00c4f\" alt=\"Colleagues Recall Shock and Horror After Journalist Committed Suicide on Live TV: 'I Didn't See the Gun'| Crime & Courts, Suicide and Attempts, True Crime\" border=\"0\" height=\"853\" width=\"640\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span> â¢ <b><em>Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? <a href=\"http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2?a=2&aid=1078530696&n=40&PEOPLE_SOURCE=crime_article\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Click here</a> to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.</em></b><br /><br />At the anchor desk, Chubbuck read three news items before she introduced the clip of the shooting. But the film jammed, at which point Chubbuck looked at he camera and calmly and clearly: \"In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in blood and guts and in living color, we bring you another firstÃ¢â¬Â¦Attempted suicide.\" <br /><br />She then drew the revolver and shot herself in the head. As she slumped forward, Rickard scrambled to fade the broadcast to black. <br /><br />At first, Rickard thought it was a morbid joke. \"I went flying out to the studio thinking it was a very uncouth joke and I was going to give her a mouthful,\" he says. <br /><br />Instead, he saw her bleeding on the studio floor. Chubbuck was rushed to the hospital and died 15 hours later. Her colleagues were left to wonder why a promising young reporter would take her life in such a public and gruesome way. <br /><br />\"It was the most unexpected thing in the world,\" says former WXLT chief engineer Dan Lunin. \"None of us had any idea there was any real problem there.
