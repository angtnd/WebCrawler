The banks' financial condition has deteriorated recently because of controls on movements of money and surging numbers of problem loans.\n\nBut on Monday afternoon, despite the tentative accord in Brussels, the European Central Bank kept a tight lid on its emergency lending to Greek banks. The central bank declined to raise a cap on emergency loans from its existing level of 89 billion euros, or nearly $99 billion, a limit that by now the banks may have already reached.\n\nThe central bank is evidently waiting for clear signs that political leaders will do everything they promised in Monday's accord. The decision means that Greek banks are not likely to reopen this week, as planned, and could soon run out of cash.\n\nAccording to the statement issued by eurozone leaders Monday morning in Brussels, a new rescue fund for Greece would include at least \u20ac10 billion, and perhaps as much as \u20ac25 billion, that would be used to replenish the capital of Greek banks or to shut them down.\n\nThe mention of bank \u201cresolution\u201d in the statement \u2014 a term meaning to shutter an insolvent lender \u2014 was acknowledgment that some banks may be so badly damaged that they cannot survive.\n\nThe agreement also calls for the European Central Bank, in its role as the eurozone\u2019s banking supervisor, to conduct a thorough review of Greek banks after the summer. Greece\u2019s four largest banks passed a health check last year, but since then, they have suffered from a decline in the Greek economy and from a drain of deposits by fearful customers.\n\nThe escalation of the crisis in Greece in recent months has hit the banks from all sides. Recent restrictions on cash withdrawals and international money transfers have been poisonous to the Greek economy, increasing the number of individuals and businesses falling behind on loan payments. Banks have seen a surge in problem loans.\n\nThe government\u2019s financial distress has undercut the value of Greek bonds, which also hurts the banks because they have large holdings of their own government\u2019s debt.\n\nForced bank closures were another blow. A bank can hardly be expected to make money when its doors are locked.\n\nBank A.T.M.s have continued to dispense cash, limited to \u20ac60 a day per depositor, but analysts expect the money to run out any day, further damaging the Greek economy.\n\nThe banks have been closed since June 29 because they ran out of sources of funds to replace the money that depositors have withdrawn. Analysts at Barclays estimate that banks have lost about 25 percent of their total deposits since December, a huge amount for banks that were already struggling.\n\nThe European Central Bank could help Greek banks most quickly by increasing the amount of emergency loans they are allowed to draw. But, during a conference call on Monday, the central bank\u2019s Governing Council decided not to lift the current ceiling on such loans.\n\nBefore risking any more money on Greece, the members of the council presumably want to be sure that the Greek Parliament will fulfill agreements made during all-night negotiations with the country\u2019s creditors.\n\nDiego Iscaro, senior economist at IHS, a market research firm, said he expected the European Central Bank to give the banks more breathing room if and when the Greek Parliament passed legislation to confirm Greece\u2019s end of the bargain. But restrictions on withdrawals and money transfers are likely to last a long time, he said.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that capital controls will have to remain in place for a prolonged period, even if the agreement is ratified by the Greek and other national parliaments,\u201d Mr. Iscaro said in a statement.","parent":{"ID":4476,"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/greek-debt-crisis-live-updates\/","title":"The Latest: Deal Is Reached on Greece&#8217;s Debt Crisis","prettytime":"Jul 13, 2015 9:51 am","datetime":"2015-07-13 09:51:43","timestamp":1436781103,"tags":["explained"],"admin_limit":50,"fe_limit":10,"status":"publish","quicktags":[],"bylines":["The New York Times"],"keywords":["Banking and Financial Institutions","European Central Bank","European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2010- )","Greece","Shutdowns (Institutional)","Tsipras, Alexis"]},"date":"2015-07-13T09:51:43","modified":"2015-07-13T09:51:43","slug":"european-central-bank-potential-rescuer-remains-wary","guid":"346-european-central-bank-potential-rescuer-remains-wary-5024","excerpt":"","sticky":false,"date_tz":"America\/New_York","date_gmt":"2015-07-13T13:51:43","modified_tz":"America\/New_York","modified_gmt":"2015-07-13T13:51:43","meta":{"links":[]},"relative_time":"1M ago","prettytime":"Jul 13, 2015 9:51 am ET","timestamp":"9:51 am ET","datestamp":"Jul 13, 2015","time":1436795503,"link":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/greek-debt-crisis-live-updates\/european-central-bank-potential-rescuer-remains-wary\/","shortlink":["http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1MptvSt"],"admin_link":"http:\/\/live-admin.em.nytimes.com\/greek-debt-crisis-live-updates\/european-central-bank-potential-rescuer-remains-wary\/","authors":[{"b_id":"5489","image":{"full":"","50":"","75":""},"twitter":"","facebook":"","email":"","website":"","scoop_id":"","title_case_name":"","name":"Jack Ewing","slug":"jack-ewing"}],"content_expanded":"<p class=\"story-body-text\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Among its many proposed measures, the eurozone\u2019s agreement on Greece calls for an overhaul of the country\u2019s rickety banking system.

measures.\n\nDerek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London, noted that the tougher the terms, the harder it would be to restore confidence in the Greek financial sector.\n\nAnd the fact that Germany proposed a \"temporary Grexit\" at one point \"could be argued as one further step toward that eventual outcome.\" The deal announced on Monday morning \"now appears to have put Grexit risks to bed for a time,\" Mr. Halpenny wrote, \"but not many will say with high confidence\" that the issue is closed.\n\nThe \"doubts and concerns in our view outweigh optimism and euphoria,\" Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt, wrote in a note. \"It starts with the fact that there actually is no deal, yet,\" only \"an agreement to start negotiations once certain conditions are met.\"\n\nThe agreement was made possible only by the fact that the Greek people overwhelmingly favor continued membership in the eurozone and the desire of other eurozone leaders to avoid a Greek departure, Mr. Brzeski wrote, not necessarily a sufficient basis for a lasting arrangement.\n\n\"To the contrary, the Grexit might have been avoided for a couple of weeks or \u2014 in a best-case scenario \u2014 for a couple of months,\" he wrote. \"But as in any good horror movie, the ghosts will always return.\"","parent":{"ID":4476,"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/greek-debt-crisis-live-updates\/","title":"The Latest: Deal Is Reached on Greece&#8217;s Debt Crisis","prettytime":"Jul 13, 2015
