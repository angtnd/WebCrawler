But Taipei was quiet, with no sense of emergency or obvious damage just before dawn.</p>","<p>Residents in mainland China also reported that the tremor was felt there. The Beijing government offered to help as needed.</p>","<p>Because of the collapse of the residential high-rise, questions surfaced about whether the 1989 structure had shoddy construction.

He had also wanted the commission to intervene immediately in individual cases, rather than just craft long-term policies to fight abuse.</p> <p>During a commission meeting Saturday, \"it was decided that Mr. Peter Saunders would take a leave of absence from his membership to consider how he might best support the commission's work,\" the Vatican said.</p> <p>The decision is a blow to Francis' efforts to show that he is tough on abuse, since the presence of Saunders and another abuse survivor, Marie Collins, had given the commission credibility.</p> <p>In an interview with The Associated Press, Saunders said commission members, with one abstention, asked had him to step aside after concluding they could no longer trust him to work within the scope of the commission's mandate.</p> <p>\"I do not want to prevent the work of the commission, the good work that the commission is doing from going ahead, so I had no choice but to step aside,\" he said.</p> <p>He said the Vatican's inaction in the face of continuing cases of children being raped and molested \"made me lose faith in the process and lose faith in Pope Francis.\"</p> <p>His departure leaves Collins as the lone abuse survivor on the commission, which was formed in 2013 to advise the Vatican on protecting children, educating church personnel and parishioners about abuse, and keeping pedophiles out of the priesthood.</p> <p>Collins told the AP it was a \"sad day\" for the commission. She acknowledged Saunders' complaints about the pace of work but said the overall mission was still important.</p> <p>\"It is slow. It's not going to make changes overnight. And there are frustrations in that,\" she said. \"But if we can change policy and get policies put in place that will stick around the world that will make children safer in the future, then it's worth making time to get it right.\"</p> <p>The commission was formed after victims' groups questioned whether the Argentine pope, who had never dealt with an abuse case, really understood the scope of the scandal. But the commission took a big step last year when it successfully proposed that the Vatican create an in-house tribunal to hear cases of bishops accused of failing to protect their flocks.</p> <p>The commission had been highly critical of Francis' decision to appoint a Chilean bishop despite allegations from abuse survivors that he had covered up for the country's most notorious pedophile, the Rev. Fernando Karadima.</p> <p>One of Karadima's victims, Juan Carlos Cruz, joined Saunders on Saturday in Rome in hopes of speaking to the commission but was refused. Cruz had been proposed as a possible commission member but emails published in the Chilean media showed how the Chilean church hierarchy worked to keep him off the panel.</p> <p>___</p> <p>Follow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield</p> </p></p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","cover_photo":{"img":{"src":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","className":"Lead-s W-max","width":640,"ratio":null,"thumb":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/wneHog9mzyr9.5cLc.1IAw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTY0O2g9MTY0O2ZpPWZpbGw7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MDtzbT0xO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/images/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS/b84eb149b60cae068f0f6a7067001f9f_original.jpg","lazySrc":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/gLNmVweScRtwY6n80Karyw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3E9NzU7dz02NDA7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/images/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS/b84eb149b60cae068f0f6a7067001f9f_original.jpg","lazyClass":"ImageLoader-Delayed"}},"enable_lead":true,"images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"ee12d0e4-70d9-3172-955f-58d8f583699e","licensed":"true","title":"Super Bowl Food: How to Enjoy Game Day Without Killing Your Diet","link":"https://www.yahoo.com/food/super-bowl-food-how-to-enjoy-game-day-without-204035670.html","summary":"If youâre excited for the big game but less-than stoked about the extra calories that come with classic Super Bowl party foods, fear not dear sports fan.

An orphan drug is one that treats an incredibly rare disease -- or one that afflicts less than 200,000 people in the U.S. When orphan drugs get approved, the companies that make them are allowed to price these medications at astronomical levels because the people with these rare diseases don't have any other choice. The government provides orphan drug developers with benefits, including tax incentives, subsidized research, enhanced patent protection, and lengthened marketing exclusivity.

Here are two of the easiest:</span></p> <h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>1. Swap \"but\" for \"and.\"</strong></span></h2> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You might be tempted to say, \"I want to go to the movies, <em>but</em> I have work to do.\"</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Instead, Roth suggests saying, \"I want to go to the movies,Â <em>and</em> I have work to do.\"</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He writes: \"When you use the word <em>but</em>, you create a conflict (and sometimes a reason) for yourself that does not really exist.\" In other words, it's possible to go to the movies as well as do your work â you just need to find a solution.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Meanwhile, when you use the wordÂ <em>and</em>, \"your brain gets to consider how it can deal with both parts of the sentence,\" Roth writes.

Explain to me how I could look at my daughters and have them look up to a President Trump as a role model.</p> <p>Trump initially joked that the questioner was a CNN plant to create a dramatic confrontation.</p> <p>\"Who asked you to give this question?\" he said. \"Did Anderson? By the way, this is a CNN setup, but that's OK.\"</p> <p>CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who was moderating the town hall, assured Trump that his network didn't feed questions to any of the audience members.</p> <p>Trump proceeded by defending some of his campaign-trail firestorms. He first defended his treatment of women by saying that his real-estate company had hired many women:</p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Thirty years ago, I had a woman building a major, major construction job in New York City. And that never happens. That just didn't happen. ... I have so many women executives. I have been great to women. And women have been great to me. They've done a great job.</p> <p>He then defended his hard-line rhetoric against illegal immigration. Trump, whose town hall was in Manchester, New Hampshire, related the immigration issue to the heroin epidemic in the state.</p> <p>He said:</p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">I do bring up things that people don't want to bring up. I talk about immigration â stronger than anybody else. I talk about building a wall. If you look at New Hampshire, you have a tremendous heroin problem. It's coming from the border!</p> <p>Trump finished his answer by addressing his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-muslim-immigration-2015-12\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">provocative proposal</a> to temporarily bar most Muslims from entering the US. Trump unveiled that proposal last December after the terror attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Paris. The candidate said that the \"world is agreeing with me\" now.</p> <p>He said:</p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">When I brought up the Muslim problem. You know, it's very interesting. I brought that problem up and all of a sudden, the world started going wild. And now the world is agreeing with me. We have to do something.

I donât believe in free college,â Clinton said, adding, âHow would you ever control the cost?â</p>","<p>âThe numbers just donât add up,â she said.</p>","<p>She also criticized Sandersâ health care proposal by claiming it would reopen a contentious debate over healthcare reform. Instead, she said she would like to improve Obamacare.</p>","<p>Sanders, however, got a laugh when Chuck Todd asked him why heâs been in Congress for so long yet has not achieved those goals.</p>","<p>âI havenât quite run for president before,â Sanders responds.</p>","<p>But Sanders argues that such proposals as free public tuition and single-payer healthcare are common in other countries, and âI do not accept the belief that the United States cannot do that.â</p>","<p>They then go intoÂ an extensive back and forth over just who is a progressive, keyed to Sandersâ tweet earlier this week that someone cannot be a progressive and a moderate at the same time, a dig at Clintonâs centrism and perhaps shifting positions.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>But there are also questions over Sanders calling himself an independent, not a Democrat, even though he caucuses with the party in the Senate.</p>","<p>9:27 pm ET<strong> âArtful smear.â</strong> Clinton accuses Sanders of an âartful smear,â with attacks that âinsinuateâ that she has been bought by Wall Street donors. âI donât think these attacks and insinuations are worthy of you. Enough is enough,â she says, before Sanders gives a grumbling sound, and they start to talk over each other. Clintonâs point: Just because I took money from sources like SuperPACs and speaking fees from Goldman Sachs doesnât mean she has been âbought.â</p>","<p>But her statement gives Sanders an opening to, once again, focus on the corrupting influence on money in politics, affecting the way that politicians have voted on issues like financial deregulation climate change. The back and forth was heated â more so than in any other debate.</p>","<p>9:44 pm ET <strong>Breaking up the banks.</strong> Sanders makes an argument for breaking up the banks.</p>","<p>âIf Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, what he would say is, âBreak them up.â They are too powerful politically and too powerful economically.â</p>","<p>Clinton says that the Dodd-Frank financial reform package is a âlaw in placeâ to assess whether a bank is too big to fail. âPresident Obama signed [the legislation] even though he took money from Wall Street. You know why? Because he is a responsible president.â Itâs another way for her to make her point that campaign contributions are not necessarily corrupting.</p>","<p>9:51 pm ET. <strong>Goldman Sachs speeches.</strong> Clinton is asked whether she would release the transcripts of her paid speeches, including those to Goldman Sachs. âI will look into it. I donât know the status, but I will certainly look into it.â She defends taking hefty sums for speeches by saying that she âspoke to a lot of groups with a lot of different members.â</p>","<p>9:57 pm ET. <strong>Twitter marks.</strong> For the record, at the midpoint of the debate, Clinton is commanding 58% of the Twitter debate conversation versus Sanders with 42%.</p>","<p>10:05 pm ET. <strong>âIf I could just add.â</strong>Â Clinton sees a weakness in Sanders on foreign policy. In fact, Sandersâ campaign has not highlighted national security all that much, to the point where co-moderator Chuck Todd tells him, âNo one knows who your foreign policy advisers are.â</p>","<p>Todd also asks Sanders about what he would do in Afghanistan, and whether he would keep the 10,000 troops who are still there. HeÂ shifts the focus to trying to prevent U.S. ground troops from getting âsucked into the perpetual quagmire of Iraq and Syria.â Pressed again to specially answer the question about Afghanistan, Sanders says, âYou canât simply withdraw tomorrow â I wish we could â and allow the Taliban to reclaim that country.â</p>","<p>Seizing on a perceived weakness, Clinton questions Sandersâ foreign policy judgments, noting statements of national security and foreign policy experts.</p>","<p>Sanders also criticized Clintonâs 2002 vote in favor of military engagement in Iraq, which he noted âcreated barbaric groups like ISIS.â</p>","<p>Clintonâs response: âA vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS.â</p>","<p>10:30 om ET. <strong>Caucus audit.</strong> Bernie Sanders minimizes disputes over the count in the Iowa caucus. He says that he supports an audit of the results but says, âletâs not blow this out of proportion. This is not a winner-take-all thing.â He notes that Clinton got 22 delegates and he got 20, out of 2,500 needed to win the nomination. He says they think they may have two more delegates. Asked if she would support an Iowa Democratic Party audit, Clinton says, âWhatever they decide to do that is fine.â</p>","<p>âBy the way I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa. I donât have to say it, because they voted already,â he says.</p>","<p>10:35 pm ET. <strong>Those damn emails.</strong> Clinton says that she is â100 percent confidentâ that nothing will come of the FBIâs examination of her use of a private email service while she was secretary of state. She slams the governmentâs system of retroactive classification, which appears to have been the case with some of the emails she has received. Sanders is asked about the issue, but says he will not âpoliticizeâ it, just as he refused to get into it at the first debate in October.</p>","<p>10:43 p.m. ET. <strong>The death penalty.</strong> Clinton says that she still supports capital punishment, but only for âvery particularly limited particularly heinous crimes.â She cites the case of Timothy McVeigh, sentenced to death for the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. She also says she disagrees with the way that âtoo many states are implementing it.â</p>","<p>Sanders does not support the death penalty, but he was hardly eager to counter Clinton on the issue. He says that âtoo many innocent people, including minorities, have been executed when they are not guilty.â</p>","<p>âIn a world of so much violence and killing, I just do not believe the government should be part of the killing,â he says.</p>","<p>10:50 pm: <strong>TPP.</strong> Sanders slams recent free trade agreements, including the recently signed Trans Pacific Partnership, because they are written âby corporate America, for corporate America.â The Hollywood motion picture lobby pushed for the TPP because of its copyright provisions.</p>","<p>Clinton also opposes the TPP, even though she was in the Obama administration when it was being negotiated. She explains that she was not satisfied that the final results protected American workers.</p>","<p>But this is a topic on which Sanders is particularly adept at framing, as he attacks the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiated during President Bill Clintonâs presidency. âI donât want American workers competing against people making 56 cents an hour,â he says.</p>","<p>11:02 pm ET. <strong>Sanders as VP.</strong> Clinton says it is âpresumptuousâ to talk about who she would choose as her running mate, but says that if she is the nominee, he will be âthe first person I callâ about âwhere we go.â</p>","<p>Sanders tries to minimize their divisions during the debate, saying that he respects Clinton and âon our worst days, I think it is fair to say, we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.â The comment gets huge applause.</p>","<p>11:08 pm ET. <strong>The takeaway.</strong> This was the best Democratic debate so far â a testament to having just two candidates on stage rather than the hit-and-run atmosphere of up to 11 at the lecterns. The two candidate format made it easier for Todd and Rachel Maddow to ask specific questions and then hold the candidates to giving specific answers, rather then be pressed for time. The result was a substantive two hours â and a bit of wonderment at why the Democratic Party never scheduled a pre-New Hampshire debate in the first place. The debate was only recently organized by MSNBC and the Union Leader, smartly on a Thursday night rather than a weekend.</p>","<p>Clinton went in ready to take on Sanders, and was especially aggressive about his campaign tactics, but she did better when she highlighted her foreign policy experience, and how she grasps some of the nuances in the chaos of Middle East. Sanders, to no surprise, was better in talking about campaign finance and free trade, signature issues that have drive his unexpected rise in the polls. Sanders has been dropping in more personal details about his life, and was particularly strong in closing by talking about his father, a Polish immigrant. Given his lead in New Hampshire, the debate probably helps Clinton more than him.</p>","<div>\n <div>\n  Related stories\n </div>\n <div>\n  <a href=\"https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-cnn-town-hall-new-hampshire-1201696502/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders at CNN's New Hampshire Town Hall: Live Blog</a>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <a href=\"https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/hillary-clinton-wins-iowa-caucus-1201694909/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Hillary Clinton Officially Wins Iowa Democratic Caucus</a>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <a href=\"https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/msnbc-f-bomb-brian-williams-apologizes-video-1201694286/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Iowa Voter Drops F-Bomb Live on MSNBC, Brian Williams Apologizes (VIDEO)</a>\n </div>\n</div>","<p><strong>Get more from <a href=\"http://variety.com\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Variety</a> and <a href=\"http://variety411.com/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Variety411</a></strong>: Follow us on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/13vZ5cP\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"><u>Twitter</u></a>, <a href=\"http://on.fb.me/UGFm1L\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"><u>Facebook</u></a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/YHELmU\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"><u>Newsletter</u></a></p>"]},"property":"movies","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"b0d8c0cc-9956-3038-9505-0eded1e01a65","licensed":"true","title":"Johnny Manziel has &#39;destroyed his value&#39; to NFL teams and put his future in jeopardy after latest incident","link":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnny-manziel-destroyed-value-nfl-143337910.html","summary":"Johnny Manziel has been involved in yet another off-field incident, and this one may end up...","entities":"WIKIID:Johnny_Manziel|WIKIID:National_Football_League|WIKIID:ESPN|WIKIID:Fort_Worth_Police_Department","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000001|YCT:001000002","publisher":"Business Insider","author":"Cork Gaines","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/eLrVyJi4LBxuWmw5_zATNA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE-/http://media.zenfs.com/284/2011/06/08/biz-insider-65x27_102440.gif","provider_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/","site":"finance","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"1183318087","propertyRegion":"YPROP:finance","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"1183318087","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Johnny_Manziel;National_Football_League;ESPN;Fort_Worth_Police_Department;Football_Sunday_on_ESPN_Radio;Dallas_Police_Department;Adam_Schefter\" rs=\"lmsid:a0770000003N6b9AAC;revsp:businessinsider.com;lpstaid:b0d8c0cc-9956-3038-9505-0eded1e01a65\"","site":"finance","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"embedded_images":{"source":"http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/Johnny_Manziel_has_destroyed_his-f25c322296df22d2fe101324ccc2379b"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"Fri, Feb 5 6:33 AM PST","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo Finance","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000001","score":"0.888889","label":"Sports & Recreation"},{"term":"YCT:001000002","score":"0.863636","label":"Football"}],"leadItem":true,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p><p><span class=\"KonaFilter image-container display-table float_right\"><span><span class=\"image\"><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/Q9C.BzjsWsKTyvkkzmKaxw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/Johnny_Manziel_has_destroyed_his-f25c322296df22d2fe101324ccc2379b\" class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" alt=\"Johnny Manziel\" data-mce-source=\"Stephen Brashear/Getty Images\" width=\"640\" height=\"480.4923076923077\" /></span><span class=\"source\">(Stephen Brashear/Getty Images) <br /></span></span></span></span>Johnny Manziel has been involved in yet another off-field incident, and this one may end up costing him his career in the NFL. <p>According to a police report released by the Fort Worth Police Department, Manziel was involved in a conflict with Colleen Crowley, his ex-girlfriend, that began at a hotel in Dallas and continued in a car and at her apartment on Friday night and early Saturday morning. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14717442/johnny-manziel-allegedly-struck-ex-girlfriend-according-police-report?ex_cid=espnapi_public\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Via ESPN</a>:</p> <p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><span>According to the police report, parts of which were blacked out, Manziel and his ex-girlfriend left the hotel after he struck her.

But now, Schefter said it was \"hard to imagine\" that happening.</p> <p>In another segment on ESPN, former NFL wide receiver Cris Carter, who had his own off-field issues during his career, was asked whether a change of scenery would help Manziel.
