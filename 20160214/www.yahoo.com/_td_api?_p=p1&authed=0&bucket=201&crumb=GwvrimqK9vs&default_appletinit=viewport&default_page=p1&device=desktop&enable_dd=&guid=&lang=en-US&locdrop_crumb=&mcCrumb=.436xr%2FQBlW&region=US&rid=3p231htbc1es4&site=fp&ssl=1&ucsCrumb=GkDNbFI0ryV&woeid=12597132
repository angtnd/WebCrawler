Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,â McConnell said. </p>","<p> Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as well as current Republican presidential candidates and Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, also came out of the gate opposing confirmation of a final Obama Supreme Court nominee. </p>","<p> <b> </b> </p>","<p> The Republican majority in the Senate gives the party leverage for a battle with Obama over a new Supreme Court nomination, but would not be without risks. Any nominee would need 60 affirmative votes on cloture to proceed to final confirmation, meaning that Obama would be under pressure to choose a more moderate versus liberal justice in order to win the at least 14 Republicans he would need to support his nominee. </p>","<p> <b> </b> </p>","<p> That pressure would vanish if Republicans cannot retake the White House in 2016 or hold their majority in the Senate. Many Republicans in D.C. are skeptical that the party will be able to do either, especially if Donald J. Trump or Ted Cruz win the GOP presidential nomination. These establishment Republicans <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/why-establishment-republicans-are-really-afraid-of-214216427.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">have seen evidence</a> that Trump or Cruz would create a drag on races lower down the ballot, such as the Senate races in November, and are worried Republicans could lose the Senate. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> <b> </b> </p>","<p><b><i><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/justice-antonin-scalia-look-back-234846615.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Slideshow: Justice Antonin Scalia â A look back</a></i></b></p>","<p> Republicans currently hold the Senate majority with 54 members, but 24 of those seats are being contested this year â including seven in states where Obama won twice. </p>","<p> If Republicans wait and Democrats win the White House and regain the Senate majority, a hypothetical President Hillary Clinton, for example, would have greater leeway to select a more liberal justice than Obama might have submitted. </p>","<p> <b> </b> </p>","<p> But the politics could also work in Republicansâ favor, as mobilization for a Supreme Court nomination by a Republican president could cause conservative voter turnout to spike in 2016, helping candidates across the board. Democrats, of course, would similarly seek to boost turnout and support based on the nomination fight (or lack thereof). </p>","<p> There is precedent for the Senate to act in a presidential year on a confirmation. Justice Anthony Kennedy was chosen by Republican President Ronald Reagan and <a href=\"http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/50146.pdf\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">confirmed by a Democratic Senate on February 3, 1988</a> â also the last year of a lame-duck presidency. </p>","<p> But <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/first-reactions-on-the-passing-of-justice-scalia/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">SCOTUSBlogâs Tom Goldstein</a> does not see a scenario in which Senate Republicans will change their minds. </p>","<p> âTheoretically, that process could conclude before the November election. But realistically, it cannot absent essentially a consensus nominee â and probably not even then, given the stakes,â he wrote. âA Democratic president would replace a leading conservative vote on a closely divided court. The Republican Senate will not permit such a consequential nomination â which would radically shift the balance of ideological power on the court â to go forward.â </p>","<p> Democrats, of course, do not see it that way, but without the Senate majority, thereâs little they can do but highlight what they believe is political negligence and then campaign on that. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid called on Obama to send a nominee to the Senate, and Obama said Saturday night he would, indeed, nominate someone. </p>","<p> The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy, released a statement mourning Scalia and calling on Republicans to work with Democrats to replace him swiftly because failing to do so would weaken democracy âfor partisan reasons.â </p>","<p> âI hope that no one will use this sad news to suggest that the president or the Senate should not perform its constitutional duty,â Leahy said. âThe American people deserve to have a fully functioning Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of the United States is too important to our democracy for it to be understaffed for partisan reasons. It is only February. The president and the Senate should get to work without delay to nominate, consider and confirm the next justice to serve on the Supreme Court.â </p>"]},"property":"politics","images":[{"caption":"Republicansâ vow to block Obama Supreme Court nominee comes with risks","id":"996849b7-29c2-34a6-85d8-6c3e31af6909","title":"Republicansâ vow to block Obama Supreme Court nominee comes with risks","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Republicansâ vow to block Obama Supreme Court nominee comes with risks","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/McPCM3PF25og7IcKJPBfTg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/afece01c34b21f5c80abb62dd4491ecb","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies at 79","id":"30a4b9f4-aa6e-3503-9317-fac3b261eaa9","title":"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies at 79","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies at 79","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/P9ZVX00wq1n.3b0q.k3tow--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/homerun/video.wpvi.abc.news.com/4bc0505dd45e31db36876784af75c810","alt":null},"index":2},{"caption":"Reaction to death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia","id":"dc3015b4-cfac-3832-a4f4-8a0d258183d5","title":"Reaction to death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Reaction to death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/7e4vw.BmNe2v6xWZnm3KaQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/homerun/video.wpvi.abc.news.com/947f72de28362df60fb1681ba3a3b5e8","alt":null},"index":3},{"caption":"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the court&#39;s longest-serving justice, has died.

Whatever the lower court decided is affirmed, and that ruling only applies to their circuit â leaving legal conflicts among circuits unresolved. Or the court can put the case over for re-argument, essentially telling both parties to try again when the court is back to a full bench, according to Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California at Irvine Law School.

A case challenging the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare for religiously affiliated nonprofits will also come before the court next month. Scalia would most likely have been the fifth vote siding with religiously affiliated groups who donât want to provide contraception, according to Professor Suzanna Sherry of Vanderbilt Law School. If that case is now decided in a 4-4 split, religious colleges would have to cover contraceptives in their health plans since lower courts upheld the mandate. (The court could decide to reargue that case instead of issuing a split decision.) A decision on whether Texasâ abortion center regulations create an illegal burden for women seeking to access abortions is less likely to be affected by Scaliaâs death, since Justice Anthony Kennedy is the swing vote in that case.

Other people pictured were described in neutral ways, such as \"loves Chinese food.\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">Both men and women rated the altruistic people as more attractive for long-term relationships â but women showed a stronger preference for altruism than men did.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://evp.sagepub.com/content/14/1/1474704915623698.full.pdf\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">More recent research</a> suggests that altruism could be even more appealing than good looks.</p> <p class=\"p1\">In a study published this year, researchers looked exclusively at heterosexual women's preferences for attractiveness and altruism in men.</p> <p class=\"p1\">About 200 women were asked to look at photographs of men's faces. Half those faces had been determined to be extremely physically attractive; the other half had been determined to be extremely physically unattractive.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The women saw two pairs of faces at a time, one attractive and one unattractive.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Each pair of faces was displayed alongside a description of a scenario and how each man behaved. For example: \"two people are walking through a busy town and see a homeless person sitting near a cafe.\" One man goes into the cafe and buys a sandwich and tea for the homeless person; the other man pretends to use his cellphone and walks straight past the homeless person.</p> <p class=\"p1\">All the women were asked to rate each man on how attractive he was for a short- or long-term relationship.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The researchers walked away with several key findings.</p> <p class=\"p1\">First, as previous research had found, altruistic men were more attractive than nonaltruistic men.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Second, altruistic men were more attractive for long-term than short-term relationships. When it came to short-term relationships, <em>nonaltruistic</em> men were in fact more desirable than altruistic men.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Perhaps the most striking finding was that altruism appeared to be even more appealing than physical attractiveness when it came to long-term relationships. Unattractive men high in altruism were rated more attractive for long-term relationshipsÂ than attractive men low in altruism.</p> <p class=\"p1\">It's hard to say whether these study findings apply to real-life interactions. But they do suggest that, if you're a man looking for a committed relationship with a woman, you shouldn't hesitate to flaunt the fact that you're an unpaid mentor for elementary-school kids or that you help your elderly neighbor buy groceries every week.</p> <p class=\"p1\">It could be an easy way to gain an edge over the more self-oriented guys out there.</p> <p>NOW WATCH: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/science-male-attractiveness-sex-2015-10\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Women are more attracted to men with these physical traits</a></p><br /><br /><b>More From Business Insider </b><br />\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/cognitive-biases-affect-relationships-2015-8/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">15 cognitive biases that screw up your relationships</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/scented-deodorant-and-confidence-2016-1\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Here's a simple way to make yourself more confident and attractive</a><br /></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mindful-men-are-more-attractive-to-women-2015-11\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Scientists say this surprising trait could make men more attractive to women</a><br /></li>\n  </ul></p> </p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance","images":[],"count":0},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"c132b8b4-53b8-3f9f-b008-7b15d53270c4","licensed":"true","title":"Tens of Thousands of Sharks Spotted &#39;A Stone&#39;s Throw&#39; From Florida Beaches","link":"http://news.yahoo.com/tens-thousands-sharks-spotted-stones-164600314.html","summary":"Blacktip sharks are swarming past a popular stretch of beach on Florida&#39;s packed Atlantic coast.","entities":"WIKIID:Florida_Atlantic_University|WIKIID:Florida|WIKIID:Palm_Beach,_Florida","autoplay":"false","categories":"YCT:001000638|YCT:001000643|YCT:001000637|YCT:001000644","publisher":"Inside Edition","author":"Inside Edition","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/TU0Wv_oqAmGHi37KLPknEA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2015-09-25/2c63c420-63be-11e5-9d1c-abbca324fa1d_e8e1b4cf340bc8858e8b44df44626ca4.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://www.insideedition.com","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"7645365","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","entity_enrichment":{"movie_id":"b3915d00-e9dc-11e0-9565-88fb6c4cba2b"},"ad_meta":{"spaceid":"7645365","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Florida_Atlantic_University;Florida;Palm_Beach,_Florida;Singer_Island;Shark_attack;Palm_Beach_County,_Florida\" ctopid=\"1996000;2051500;2056000\" hashtag=\"1996000;2051500;2056000\" rs=\"lmsid:a0ad000000AxIEjAAN;revsp:inside_edition;lpstaid:c132b8b4-53b8-3f9f-b008-7b15d53270c4\"","site":"news","region":"US","lang":"en-US"},"embedded_images":{"source":"http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/inside_edition/ef165a8a0ec19eee8041509d1779990f"},"hosted":true,"publicationDate":"52 minutes ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo - ABC News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000638","score":"0.949206","label":"Environment"},{"term":"YCT:001000643","score":"0.941176","label":"Living Nature"},{"term":"YCT:001000637","score":"0.859296","label":"Nature"},{"term":"YCT:001000644","score":"0.571429","label":"Animals"}],"leadItem":true,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<p><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/PTEmcxVM.42MCQrkNO470w--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjMwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/inside_edition/ef165a8a0ec19eee8041509d1779990f\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" border=\"0\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span></p>","<p>The severe cold snap may have you planning your Florida getaway, but you might want to watch this video first.</p>","<p>Researchers flying above the Sunshine State's Atlantic coast on Friday spotted a massive migration of black tip sharks swimming uncomfortably close to popular beaches.</p>","<br>","<div class=\"fb-post\"> \n <div class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"> \n  <blockquote cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/330426483825114/videos/460076480860113/\"> \n   <p>Fantastic aerial survey flight this morning.
