Trump delivers a speech on Jan. 18, 2016. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</i></p>","<p>Donald Trumpâs support from self-identified evangelical voters has sparked a debate among Christian leaders over what that term means, and a move to narrow the definition of this term or abandon it altogether. </p>","<p>The civil war within American Christianity that Trumpâs candidacy has sparked is similar to the one going on inside the Republican Party, with a particularly large faction dead set against ever supporting Trump. </p>","<p>The split is between a subset of evangelicals best categorized as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/03/07/a-conversation-how-can-evangelicals-support-trump-part-1/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">âcreedalâ believers</a>Â â those who take their faith most seriously and who oppose Trump. Less devout Christians, often described as ânotionalâ or âcultural,â are more open to the businessman and GOP frontrunner. The majority of national evangelical leaders are on the side of creedal believers. </p>","<p>If Trump becomes the Republican nominee, many of these creedal evangelicals who have traditionally voted Republican say they would distance themselves from the GOP. But nobody knows whether this would result in evangelicals moving over to vote for the Democratic nominee or whether there would be a broader movement among conservatives to form a third party. </p>","<p>Nonetheless, many anti-Trump Christian leaders believe that the American church has been in decline for decades, leaving many casual Christians â for whom faith is more of a cultural identity rather than a day-to-day experience â vulnerable to Trumpâs appeals to anger and resentment. </p>","<p>Anti-Trump evangelicals have not quite questioned the faith of Trump voters. But theyâve come close, arguing that Trump supporters are not applying Christian thinking and values to their decisions at the polls. </p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>âFor some evangelicals, Christianity is no longer shaping their politics,â Peter Wehner, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/opinion/campaign-stops/what-wouldnt-jesus-do.html?_r=0\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">wrote recently</a>. âWith Mr. Trump in view, their faith lies subordinate.â</p>","<p>Mike Farris, the chancellor of Patrick Henry College, a Christian university in Northern Virginia, told me that Christians who âstay true to their faithâ would vote for someone other than Trump. </p>","<p>And Russell Moore, head of the Southern Baptist Conventionâs public policy arm, considers a vote for Trump âdeeply inconsistent with an application of the Christian faith.â Moore wrote an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/02/29/russell-moore-why-this-election-makes-me-hate-the-word-evangelical/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">op-ed</a> in February for the Washington Post with the headline,Â âWhy this election makes me hate the wordÂ âevangelical.ââ</p>","<p>These Christian leaders see Trump as the antithesis of everything they and their faith stand for. Trumpâs arrogance and brashness â including his statement that he has never had to ask God for forgiveness â contradict their belief in the importance of humility. His past infidelities, divorces and his long record of misogynistic comments stand in opposition to their high regard for personal character. They see Trumpâs willingness to lie, blatantly and repeatedly, as morally wrong, alarming and insulting. </p>","<p>To take just one example, this past Sunday Trump denied that heâd said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was not a war hero because he was captured and held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. âOh no, no, no. What I was â I never did that. You know that,â Trump <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/trump-dodges-m\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">said in Ohio</a> to Keith Maupin, whose son Matt was taken prisoner in Iraq and killed. </p>","<p>In July, however, Trump said publicly â in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1ajHAeXMU\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">conversation that was videotaped</a>Â â that McCain was a âloserâ because he lost the 2008 presidential election, and said of McCain, âHeâs not a war hero.â</p>","<p>âHeâs a war hero because he was captured. I liked people that werenât captured,â Trump said.</p>","<p>Finally, evangelical leaders see Trumpâs inclination toward bullying, his <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2016/02/29/5-reasons-every-american-should-oppose-donald-trump/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">admiration for tyrannical governments</a> and his disregard for the rule of law as indications he would seek to use power despotically himself.</p>","<p>True power and strength, according to the Christian faith, is found in service, self-sacrifice for others and in loving and forgiving oneâs enemies.</p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/BBc4pjolg3_cOn0hZLAEhg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://36.media.tumblr.com/5d6378667788ce76f531cf9620d78122/tumblr_inline_o4265yn1vY1t2npxi_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"398.6758952753536\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Trump shakes hands with Jerry Falwell Jr. at a campaign rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Jan. 31. (Photo: Scott Morgan/Reuters)</i></p>","<p>The response to all these concerns from the most prominent evangelical leader supporting Trump is simple. </p>","<p>âWeâre not voting for a pastor-in-chief,â <a href=\"https://www.liberty.edu/champion/2016/03/falwell-speaks/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">says Jerry Falwell, Jr.</a>, the president of Liberty University. </p>","\n<!-- more -->","<p>âGod called King David a man after Godâs own heart, even though he was an adulterer and a murderer,â Falwell said recently in an interview with the Liberty student newspaper. âYou have to choose the leader that would make the best king or president, and not necessarily someone who would be a good pastor.â</p>","<p>(When Falwellâs comment was made public over the weekend, many evangelicals immediately took to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonward11/status/709005240436019200\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Twitter</a> to point out that David repented and asked God to forgive his sins, unlike Trump.)</p>","<p>On that score, Falwell says he thinks Trump is the best leader to stop terrorist attacks, reduce illegal immigration and deal with the national debt. </p>","<p>âI think maybe after the country is saved and restored, perhaps evangelicals will start voting in traditional patterns again,â Falwell told the newspaper. </p>","<p>Falwellâs dismissal of concerns over Trumpâs character and moral core are similar to the way many other Christian voters think about Trump. Most donât focus on, or donât care, about Trumpâs personal background. They just want him to fix whatever problem they think is foremost in the United Stats, whether thatâs too much free trade and joblessness, or Christian values not being respected enough, or the size and scope of the federal government. Â </p>","<p>Falwell is one of the few national evangelical leaders standing behind Trump. Robert Jeffress, the head of a 11,000-member Southern Baptist megachurch in Dallas, is more of a regional figure. Franklin Graham, son of the famous evangelist Billy Graham and head of the Christian aid group Samaritanâs Purpose, has spoken favorably of Trump but has not formally endorsed him. And Trumpâs only other significant religious backers are televangelists and prosperity preachers such as Paula White and Kenneth Copeland, whose reception around the evangelical world is decidedly mixed. </p>","<p>White recently spoke at a rally for Trump and defended his faith. âHe loves God,â she said. Raising the religious liberty issue that concerns many conservative Christians, White said that Trump would protect those who worry âthat wholesale persecution is coming to the faithful in the U.S.â</p>","<p>Concern about an anti-Christian mood in the country is a high priority for many Trump supporters who are practicing, devout Christians. </p>","<p>âMany Christians â and believers in other faith traditions as well â are feeling overwhelmed, sidelined and misunderstood,â write the Barna Groupâs David Kinnaman and co-author Gabe Lyons in their new book, âGood Faith: Being a Christian When Society Thinks Youâre Irrelevant and Extreme.â</p>","<p>âThis isnât just a feeling,â they write. âWhen one-third of college-aged adults want nothing to do with religion, and 59 percent of Christian young adults drop out of church at some point in their 20s, itâs the new reality.â</p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/fWHhloRCfT61QX_RIHiQaA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://33.media.tumblr.com/ad52e74f0a160ca8d6371e76cb2724c0/tumblr_inline_o42687DhZ01t2npxi_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"148.90380313199105\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p>One factor complicating attempts to understand how religion may be driving voters in this presidential election cycle is that when the term âevangelicalâ is defined â instead of letting poll respondents self-identify â support for Trump within that community drops off dramatically. </p>","<p>Among evangelicals who go to church every week or regularly, one <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/3/7/11174064/do-christians-really-favor-trump\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Barna Group study</a> found, Cruz is the preferred candidate of 30 percent, while Trump earned 24 percent, Rubio 14 percent and a handful of other candidates 30 percent. In the South Carolina primary, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431686/ted-cruz-evangelicals-churchgoers-back-him-non-churchgoers-dont\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">did well</a> in counties where church attendance is low, and poorly in counties where church attendance is high. </p>","<p>The Barna Group has also worked to drill down with even more detail to identify serious, practicing evangelicals. In late January, it conducted a weeklong national survey of 869 registered voters. If anyone identified as a Christian, pollsters asked them nine theological questions. (The questions are listed at the end of this article.) Voters who answered affirmatively to all nine questions were classified as evangelicals. Voters who answered yes to some of the questions but not all were labeled either ânon-evangelical born againâ or ânotional Christian.â</p>","<p>âAmong evangelicals, voters were split between Cruz (38 percent) and Carson (35 percent). Rubio only attracted 14 percent, and Trump got 11 percent,â said Barnaâs Kinnaman, who conducted the survey. </p>","<p>âNon-evangelical born again voters showed little resemblance to the preferences of their evangelical brethren,â Kinnaman wrote. âAmong the non-evangelical born-again public, Trump was the clear favorite (38 percent), equaling the support for Cruz (23 percent) and Carson (15 percent) combined.â</p>","<p>And among notional Christians, Trumpâs numbers were even higher. He drew 43 percent of their support, compared to Rubioâs 26 percent and Cruzâs 15 percent. </p>","<p>Itâs also worth noting that Trumpâs support numbers are higher among Catholics than they are among evangelicals. Trump won 30 percent of Catholics in New Hampshire, compared to 27 percent of evangelicals, and 44 percent of Catholics in Iowa, compared to just 22 percent of evangelicals there. In South Carolina, Trump captured 42 percent of the Catholic vote while picking up one-third of evangelicals. </p>","<p>But among Catholics as well, there is a divide between grassroots voters who have been marking their ballots for Trump and national elites who oppose his candidacy. A group of 37 Catholic leaders <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432437/donald-trump-catholic-opposition-statement\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">signed a letter</a> this past week urging their fellow believers to support other Republican candidates. </p>","<p>âWe understand that many good people, including Catholics, have been attracted to the Trump campaign because the candidate speaks to issues of legitimate and genuine concern,â states the letter, written by Robby George of Princeton University and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. </p>","<p>âWe urge our fellow Catholics and all our fellow citizens to consider, however, that there are candidates for the Republican nomination who are far more likely than Mr. Trump to address these concerns, and who do not exhibit his vulgarity, oafishness, shocking ignorance, and â we do not hesitate to use the word â demagoguery,â they wrote. </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/DlTswgGOwmlsESxh02u1MQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTk0O3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/437ad929fbc6841ce9be03e6dbc5cd65/tumblr_inline_o426aeoql91t2npxi_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"594\" height=\"396\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Trump supporters pray at a campaign rally in Radford, Va., on February 29, 2016. (Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg for Getty Images)</i></p>","<p>The fact that evangelical support for Trump comes primarily from those for whom orthodox belief or daily practice of their faith is least in evidence indicates that something other than theology is driving their political decisions. </p>","<p>âThereâs a class component. Working-class and lower-class white evangelicals have tended to like Trump,â said John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron in Ohio. âThe social profile of the evangelicals for Trump is remarkably similar to the non-evangelical Trump supporter.â</p>","<p>âIt suggests it has more to do with class and economics,â Green said. </p>","<p>There is disagreement among Christians about whether Barna defines evangelicals too narrowly. The National Association of Evangelicals estimates that about 30 percent of the country should be defined as evangelical. But Barna, with its more detailed questions and precise definition, says evangelicals are more like 7 to 11 percent of the population. </p>","<p>And just as conservatives who believe in ideological orthodoxy oppose Trump because he threatens to fundamentally change the belief system of the Republican Party, evangelical leaders who oppose Trump do so because they say he is compromising the core message of Christianity.</p>","<p>Moore said the roots of the Trump phenomenon were clear to him six years ago, when then-Fox News personality Glenn Beck held a massive rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The response from evangelicals to a Mormon TV celebrity calling for religious revival demonstrated to Moore that many Christians had lost sight of the true aims of their faith. </p>","<p>âI had all these Christians tweeting, âTurn on C-SPAN. Glenn Beck is preaching the gospel,ââ Moore said. </p>","<p>That word â gospel â means âgood newsâ in its original Greek form. To the most devoted evangelicals, the term refers to something very specific: the good news of the Christian gospel is the virgin birth, sinless life and substitutionary death of Jesus Christ, to save sinners and reconcile them to God. </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/yiCeVPG2gTFqu0bz0Doiyg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://33.media.tumblr.com/aef8a3e57c2cafd42fe655b4c5e07571/tumblr_inline_o426eeLajg1t2npxi_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"166.08501118568233\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p>That message, and its implications for everyday living, is what evangelicals like Moore believe Christians are called and commanded to devote their lives to embodying and sharing. </p>","<p>But many evangelicals have begun to look to cultural or political outcomes to be a different form of âgood news,â Moore said. </p>","<p>With the Beck rally, Moore said, âwhat you had happening was a populist movement led by a charismatic figure that religious Christians were encouraged to embrace as a civil religious awakening in the country.â</p>","<p>âWhatâs happening now is you have the very same sort of populist sloganeering coming from Donald Trump,â he said. âWhere people were encouraged to ignore Glenn Beckâs heretical Christology, now many Christians are ignoring Donald Trumpâs personal character, and many of them are receiving him as a Christian, while redefining the gospel to do so.â</p>","<p>âThe faith demands priority over the politics. The faith should shape the politics, not the other way around,â Moore said. âAnd once that is compromised, then the entire point is winning elections and building coalitions. If thatâs the case, then whatever is in the majority at the moment can be seen as right.â</p>","<p>In that sense, Moore and a substantial number of other evangelical leaders believe, Trump is misleading American Christians about the very nature of power. Rather than having confident faith that empowers them to love and serve others, Trump has tapped into fear and anger, and channeled it into hatred of <a href=\"http://www.evangelismcoach.org/2013/14-bible-verses-on-welcoming-the-stranger/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">the stranger</a>. </p>","<p><b>* * *</b></p>","<p><i>The National Association of Evangelicals <a href=\"http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/april/defining-evangelicals-in-election-year.html?share=35a6ZrIaP7WvProWRrmYuUpiNAZ3BGib\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">estimates that about 30 percent</a> of the country should be defined as evangelical, based on polling that defined the term around affirmative answers to four questions.

All five children survived. </p>","<p> âAfter that, I had enough,â Batoul says. âI had to leave. So we decided we would leave for Turkey and never return to Syria.â </p>","<p> At 4 a.m., she told her children they were going on a trip. She packed the necessities and left the wedding albums. They rolled into Raqqa, Syria around sunrise, and by sunset, they had crossed the Turkish border. </p>","<br>","<br>"," It was Sept. 10, 2014. Born and raised in Deir Ezzor, a strategic city in eastern Syria on the banks of the Euphrates River, Batoul had never set foot out of Syria. Now, she was leaving alone with five children under the age of 10, in the middle of the night. ","<br>","<br>","<p> Reunited with her husband Laith, 31, in Turkey, a sixth Hilel child was born in a refugee camp: Fahed, now 14 months old. Batoul turned 29 in that refugee camp on the Turkish border. And marked her 10th wedding anniversary in a tent. </p>","<p> Thatâs also where Batoul was forced to leave her two eldest children. Aday, 10 and Hala, 11, made the journey to Germany with a cousin months later, after the family had saved up enough money. Batoul and Laith traveled with baby Fahed, Hamudeh, 3, Fatima, 5, and Tib, 7. </p>","<p> ABC News met the Hilels a year into their journey in Izmir, Turkey. </p>","<p> Izmir is a coastal resort city once flush with summer weekenders from Istanbul and now flush with <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/europe-migrant-crisis.htm\" id=\"ramplink_refugees_\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">refugees</a> and migrants. </p>","<p> They slept everywhere: on the sidewalks, next to the mosque, in parks. </p>","<p> The Hilels found a small patch of grass on a quieter street -- pieces of cardboard stacked, wet laundry hanging on a bush. </p>","<p> At night, temperatures dropped into the 30s as wind whipped off the Aegean Sea through the city streets. </p>","<p> âI reached a stage where I did not even have a blanket to cover my children,â Batoul says. âWe covered them with cardboard. </p>","<p> âI felt the world was very bad.â </p>","<p> As a mother, she says \"I can't even describe to you.\" </p>","<br>","<br>","<p> It costs $1,200 a person to travel the 10 miles of open water from Turkey to Europe. Such is the market rate in Izmir. The middlemen round up their clients, taking a small cut. </p>","<p> But even the middlemen donât know the identities of the smugglers. Some are Kurdish mafia, refugees said, while others we saw were Pakistani. Few spoke Arabic, the only language the Hilels speak. </p>"],"remaining_body":["\n<!--pagebreak-->","<p> Armed watchmen guarded the curvy Turkish coastal roads at night. Taxis full of Syrians raced in convoys down to the beach, turning off headlights to avoid detection. </p>","<p> On the night of their departure, the Hilels hid in the bushes at the launch point in Ãesme, Turkey, just down the road from Izmir. They were jumpy when we arrived. They had failed to launch six nights in a row and their nerves were frayed. </p>","<p> âI die, I die, who cares? That is enough. But if we go back to Syria, we will die for sure,â Batoul says. </p>","<br>","<br>","<p> On that seventh night, a smuggler whose name they never learned pushed them toward Europe. </p>","<p> âThey call it the 'journey of death,'â Batoul says. </p>","<p> And for good reason, because more than 4,000 people attempting that same journey have died in the past year, according to the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration. </p>","<p> Their rubber dinghy, designed for 20, sagged under the weight of 45 people and the boat started to sink almost immediately. None of the kids knew how to swim. </p>","<p> As the Greek Coast Guard approached, Batoul waved her son Fahed above her head in a desperate attempt to catch their attention. It worked. The Coast Guard spotted the baby -- cold, wet, crying -- in his bright-yellow life jacket. âWe totally lost hope that we would be saved from the sea.â </p>","<p> They had been in the water for six straight hours, Batoul says. </p>","<p> The Blue Star ferry boat we took made the same short journey in 45 minutes. No one wore life jackets. </p>","<p> For the next 17 days, and about 2,000 miles, we rarely took the same form of transportation at the same time as the Hilels. At each border crossing, we passed through passport control while they were forced to cross illegally. </p>","<p> Thatâs how we were separated in <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/hungary.htm\" id=\"ramplink_Hungary_\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Hungary</a>. </p>","<p> Despite the changed realities of today, in the summer of 2015, traveling from <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/macedonia.htm\" id=\"ramplink_Macedonia_\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Macedonia</a> to Hungary was the easy part of this march north through Europe.

The barbed wire parted for the tracks, though we never saw a train pass. </p>","<p> It was a 3 mile walk from Serbia into Hungary. A long 3 miles for little legs, but those resilient kids skipped into Hungary, quite literally. There were games played on the trackâs trestles and apples snatched off trees as we walked, and they giggled, as children do. </p>","<p> Batoul and husband Laith encouraged their family as if out for a Saturday hike. âA little bit longer and then weâll take a water break,â Batoul would promise. âAlmost there.â </p>","<p> An aunt fainted in the 100-degree heat, a pregnant cousin in her 39th week stopped frequently to lie down, but none of the children cried. </p>","<p> We waved goodbye at the Hungarian border, planning to see them in a few hours. </p>","<p> A few hours came and went with no word. </p>","<br>","<div> \n <div> \n  \n </div> \n <p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BC-I7uMCeD1/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">They headed into #Hungary illegally and passport control beckoned. \"See you on the other side,\" I waved.

Somewhere. </p>","<p> We checked every camp in Hungary and moved north to Austria. Still no sign of the family. Finally, in Munich, a kind Red Cross woman squeezed my shoulder: \"You can't find them. They must find you.\" </p>","<p> We watched the waves of people flowing into Munich's train station. She was right. </p>","<p> The train station in Munich was one of the places where we would eventually find the Hilels. </p>","<br>","<br>","<p> The Hilels had spent seven cold nights in a low-security, prison-turned-refugee detention center in southern Hungary. No hot food, no hot water. Caged like animals, sleeping on cell floors. </p>","<p> Each person received one bread roll a day, and going to the bathroom required a police escort. </p>","<p> âThe children were hungry. I couldnât do anything for them,â Batoul says, again crying, remembering months later. âThey didnât understand.â </p>","<p> Locked in, Batoul suffered another kind of hell. Once again pregnant, she miscarried in her first trimester. </p>","<p> âIt was torture for me,â she says of her solitary agony. </p>","<p> Only later did she tell her husband. </p>","<p> Finally released, we found the Hilels on a train platform in northern Hungary. </p>","<br>","<div> \n <div> \n  \n </div> \n <p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BC-IY7wCeDE/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">It was a long road to safety.

She carried them, twirling them as she marched into Austria barefoot. They were still, after all, her favorite shoes. </p>","<p> As they neared the border, a Red Cross table overflowed with food and water and, sensing an oasis, the kids all ran toward the provisions. </p>","<p> That night, while the Hilels piled into the back of a big van headed for the Vienna train station, we got into our van, too, speeding off down the same highway. </p>","<p> But while they spent their last night before Germany in Viennaâs main train station, we slept in a warm hotel. </p>","<p> Westbahnhof, like many train stations, is cold and wind blows through from the tracks. The floors are hard cement, but the Hilel family didn't care. They were so close. </p>","<p> High-fives were shared and tears of exhaustion flowed as refugees emerged from the trains in Munich, Germany. </p>","<p> The Hilels were diverted from Munich onto another train, but that night they slept in clean sheets at a processing center near Dusseldorf, Germany. </p>","<p> \"We feel like humans,â Laith said just hours after arriving in Dusseldorf. âOur dignity is respected.\" </p>","<p> During the fall of 2015, crowds of Germans cheered with signs reading âWelcome to Germany!â Now, six months later, no one is cheering. </p>","<br>","<br>","<p> The Hilels arrived in Germany three months ago. As they transited through different processing centers, the family's asylum paperwork was filed and a court date was set for later this month. </p>","<p> The Hilels are just eight of more than 1 million refugees and asylum seekers now living in Germany. The backlash against the new arrivals was swift and harsh but, thankfully, not universal. </p>","<p> Friends of Batoulâs told her about neo-Nazis hurling rocks through their windows. Batoul and Laith worried they would be next. </p>","<p> âFor sure there are people who donât want us here [in Germany],â Batoul says. âFor sure.â </p>","<p> âBut not here,â Batoul says of Hattstedt, their new hometown. </p>","<br>","<br>","<p> With a population of about 2,000, it is an upper-middle-class suburb outside the nearby city of Husum. </p>","<p> It is a winding residential neighborhood, with Volkswagens and Volvos in every driveway, next to neat brick houses. Surprisingly quiet, itâs a family neighborhood, filled with blond German families. </p>","<p> âI know that a village doesnât have noise and traffic. I love noise and vibrant cities,\" Batoul says. </p>","<p> But refugees get little choice in the matter and the state disperses families based on availability. </p>","<p> Secretly, she says, she had been praying to be placed somewhere near other Syrians in a bigger city. Although nearby Husum has one mosque, itâs a different sect, so they donât attend frequently. </p>","<br>","<br>","<p> Husum's Islamic Center is the only place to buy halal meat, the only kind of meat Batoul serves at home. The Hilels are Arabic-speaking Muslims, and their neighbors are mostly German-speaking Catholics. </p>","<p> Itâs isolating, both parents say, and lonely. But language and education top the Hilels' priority list. </p>","<p> The kids are adapting, picking up the German language quickly, and each one, except Fahed, is in school. </p>","<br>","<div> \n <div> \n  \n </div> \n <p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BAPOGCjieL8/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">\"Eins, zwei, drei...\" After second day of kindergarten.

There is a common ground for us to get something done.â</p> \n</blockquote>","<p>As the system stands now, Goodell acts as judge, jury and executioner â phrasing that NFLPA officials have used effectively, they believe, to demonstrate how unfair the system is (even though it's the one they agreed to in the last CBA written in 2011).</p>","<p>The NFLPA would like to see a procedural change for how punishments and appeals for off-field issues and violations of the NFL's personal-conduct policy are handled. The two sides have traded proposals, and a resolution might not be imminent â not likely, say, before the league's annual meeting next week in Boca Raton, Fla., but perhaps by the spring meeting in late May.</p>","<p>NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy acknowledged that there had been negotiations on the matter, saying player discipline was \"an important area that deserves to be addressed thoughtfully and with full consideration for everyoneâs interests â players, clubs and fans.\"</p>","<p>How could things change? It appears that the union is pushing for a neutral arbitrator to oversee the disciplinary process in some form or fashion, either as the first set of ears to hear cases or the last. Goodellâs handling discipline cases â everything from Tom Brady and the deflate-gate controversy all the way through the spate of domestic violence cases involving Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy â has drawn heavy ire from the union, media and fans.</p>","<p>This could be a big win for the players, who feel that they're not being served fairly in these matters. And could this perhaps be the first domino toward Brady's case with the league being settled? Smith said that any agreement about player discipline would require settling ongoing appeals, which would include the NFLâs appeal against the decision handed down by Judge Richard Bermanâs on deflate-gate.</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Berman might have ruled for Brady, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges came down hard on Brady's lawyers, which might make a settlement a prudent thing for all parties. Including the many people who would love nothing more than the deflate-gate nightmare be put to bed once and for all.</p>","<p>âItâs a player decision with what they want to do, but I canât imagine there is any appetite to agree with any proposal that doesnât wrap up all the litigation,â Smith said. âWe can either continue to litigate or reach a collectively bargained conclusion.â</p>","<p id=\"yui-tmp-10\" style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"Ta-c \"><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><em>- - - - - - -</em></span></p>","<p><strong><a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/author/eric-edholm/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Eric Edholm</a></strong> is a writer for <a href=\"http://www.shutdowncorner.com\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\"><strong>Shutdown Corner</strong></a> on Yahoo Sports.

Some cybersecurity experts and privacy advocates are loath to concede that going dark is a problem at all, while many in law enforcement are scornful of what they see as decisions motivated by business interests and remain adamant that anything less than a real-time, on-demand decryption capability is unacceptable.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-newsletter-business-confidential-signup-page-htmlstory.html?v=16\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">SIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter >></a></strong></p> <p>It does not have to be like this. There are solutions that allow law enforcement to gather the evidence it needs without introducing encryption backdoors. Here are three worthy of consideration:</p> <p>First, Congress could empower law enforcement to exploit existing security flaws. Put simply, law enforcement should have the ability to hack into a suspect's smartphone or computer with a court order, such as a warrant.</p> <p>As some prominent computer security experts have argued, lawful hacking would allow authorities to use existing vulnerabilities to obtain evidence instead of creating new backdoors.</p> <p>Although this would entail law enforcement adopting the same techniques as criminals, tight judicial oversight would ensure it is employed responsibly, like the restrictions that already apply to wiretapping.</p> <p>Second, the executive branch should explore developing a national capacity to decrypt data for law enforcement. The challenge of going dark affects state and local law enforcement the most: They are the least likely to have the resources and technical capabilities to decrypt data relevant to investigations. Creating a national decryption capability, housed within the FBI and drawing upon the expertise of the National Security Agency, would provide assistance to state and local law enforcement, similar to what the FBI provides for fingerprint and biometric data.</p> <p>Third, and most important, law enforcement must improve its tech literacy. Law enforcement was confronted with a problem akin to going dark when, in the 1990s, organized-crime suspects started using disposable phones that hampered wiretaps. Nevertheless, law enforcement, and arrests and prosecution of organized-crime suspects continued.</p> <p>Running into an encrypted communication does not necessarily mean an evidence trail will go cold. Encryption can occur on a device, as the data are transmitted and when they are stored in the cloud. Encryption in one avenue doesn't necessarily mean the other two avenues will also be encrypted.</p> <p>For example, Apple can access the content of an encrypted iPhone if it has been backed up to iCloud. Recognizing how and when encryption occurs, and the different security offerings of service providers, may help law enforcement. Better tech literacy might have avoided the current Apple-FBI fight. The FBI could have obtained more information from the San Bernardino attacker's iPhone if it had not hastily ordered the county to reset his iCloud password.</p> <p>These proposals will not be fully acceptable to technologists or law enforcement. Some in tech will recoil at the idea of the NSA supporting law enforcement, while others will resent the need to keep pace with Silicon Valley's offerings. Nevertheless, a one-size-fits-all solution isn't likely. The debate has been going on in one form or another for more than 20 years. It's time to consider some realistic solutions.</p> <p><em>Adam Segal is the director and Alex Grigsby is the assistant director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Trump's brand of populism is finding a receptive audience in Ohio, just as it did in Michigan a week earlier, and he is promising to claw back outsourced jobs.</p> <p>\"Ohio is going to make America great again,\" Trump said in an airplane hangar, his jet idling behind him. \"Kasich cannot make America great again.\"</p> <p>Unlike other Trump rallies in recent days, there were no interruptions from protesters. Part of that came from the staging: guests had to be bussed from a nearby shopping center, and protesters would be stranded at a regional airfield once they were ejected.</p> <p>Trump was unrelenting against Kasich, someone he had before largely ignored. \"Your governor is totally over-rated. Without oil, you'd be in worse shape than any other state in the union,\" Trump said, noting Ohio's economy is propped up on fracking boom.</p> <p>Trump is locked in a tight race against Kasich. The entire state GOP establishment is aligned with Kasich, and polls have consistently showed Kasich up by a few percentage points. Kasich has yet to win a single state, but he could play the role of spoiler if he wins Ohio and its 66 delegates. Kasich allies were pushing that message hard in recent days, that a vote for Kasich was more importantly a vote against Trump. If Kasich fails here, it's tough to see how he justifies staying in the race.</p> <p>Trump's pathway to winning enough delegates becomes much harder without Ohio's share. He can still reach the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination, of course, but it would be tough. A Kasich win makes it ever more likely that Republicans arrive at their convention in Cleveland without a nominee.</p> <p>Trump was working hard to remedy that, pandering without restraint to voters in the Mahoning Valley. \"We're bringing your business back. We're bringing your jobs back. I love you, Ohio,\" Trump roared.</p> <p>Trump used air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier as an example of how he would will back entire industries through sheer force. \"Carrier, guess what? This is your president. This is not very presidential,\" Trump said, promising to be a bully for the working man. \"I'm more interested in having jobs in this country than acting presidential.\" He said he'd do the same to Ford, which has an emptied-out factory around the corner from the Cleveland airport, and Nabisco, which is moving a Chicago-area plant to Mexico. \"I'm not eating Oreos anymore.\"</p> <p>Trump also promised a 35% tariff on goods being brought into the country in a move that would likely start an economically devastating trade war. \"I'm going to do it,\" Trump said.</p> <p>Trump cast all woes as the fault of free-trade agreements. \"You're losing your jobs. You're losing your income,\" he said blaming in turns Mexico, China, India and Vietnam. \"I'm bringing the jobs back. I'm bringing the jobs back. I'm bringing them back from China. I'm bringing them back from Mexico,\" he repeated time and again with no credible policy beyond his persona.</p> <p>It might not matter. Trump's goal in the closing hours of the campaign in Ohio was to trash Kasich enough to force him to a second-place finish. (Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz largely abandoned Ohio, looking to Tuesday's vote in Florida, Rubio's own state. Rubio encouraged his Ohio supporters to side with Kasich.) \"You've got to boot Kasich,\" Trump told his audience. \"When he was in Congress, he signed NAFTA. It destroyed Ohio.\"</p> <p>He added that Kasich supports a pending Pacific trade deal. \"It's going to take all of your car business out,\" Trump promised, just down the road from the GM plant in Lordstown. Beyond the usual bluster that is a signature at Trump rallies, the showman was unyielding against Kasich. A Kasich win here might be one of the last fail-safes against a Trump nomination.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on Time.com.</em></p> <p> <strong>More from Fortune.com</strong> \n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/14/donald-trump-brokered-convention/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Dear Trump Haters, a Brokered Convention Won't Happen</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/14/chelsea-clinton-theranos-fundraiser/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Chelsea Clinton Is Holding a Fundraiser With the Embattled Theranos CEO</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/14/cliff-asness-eulogy-op-ed/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">How His Father's Death Changed Cliff Asness' Views of Trump Supporters</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/14/hillary-clinton-northern-marianas-win/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Why Hillary Clinton's Win in the Northern Marianas Matters</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/14/what-donald-trump-can-teach-you-about-the-narcissists-in-your-life/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">What Donald Trump Can Teach You About the Narcissists in Your Life</a></li>\n  </ul> </p><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed editorial\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/L1HnkYvDV6Fubq0Yu8O_rg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTtxPTc1O3NtPTE-/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fortune.com&amp;blog=64089429&amp;post=1587065&amp;subd=fortunedotcom&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></span></p>"],"remaining_body":[]},"property":"finance"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"true","id":"1dd82ca1-fbaf-3f9c-8af0-3085735dc645","licensed":"true","title":"Police struggle to keep lid on rowdy spring breakers","link":"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/spring-break-police-lack-control-over-rowdy-college-students/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17","summary":"Local police forces in Florida overwhelmed by the thousands of partiers who they say are becoming increasingly confrontational","entities":"WIKIID:Spring_break|WIKIID:Spring_Breakers|WIKIID:Miami_Beach,_Florida|WIKIID:Miami|WIKIID:Student","categories":"YCT:001000780|YCT:001000667","publisher":"CBS News","author":"CBSNews","author_info":null,"provider_logo":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/M6hY6dzOuUMBqCqOIq8E_g--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE7aWw9cGxhbmU-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/news/2014-08-25/41743890-2ca1-11e4-b761-2f3f006c2c02_cbsnews_106x27.png.cf.jpg","provider_url":"http://www.cbsnews.com/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17","site":"frontpage","region":"us","lang":"en-US","spaceid":"1197762606","propertyRegion":"YPROP:news","ad_meta":{"spaceid":"1197762606","site_attribute":"wiki_topics=\"Spring_break;Spring_Breakers;Miami_Beach,_Florida;Miami;Student;Alan_Diaz;Beach_Party;Panama_City_Beach,_Florida\" ctopid=\"1996000;2051500;2054000;18857489;18858989\" hashtag=\"1996000;2051500;2054000;18857489;18858989\" rs=\"lmsid:a0Vd0000005W2RtEAK;revsp:cbsnews.cbs.com;lpstaid:1dd82ca1-fbaf-3f9c-8af0-3085735dc645\"","site":"offnetwork","region":"us","lang":"en-US"},"hosted":false,"publicationDate":"14 hours ago","comScoreMeta":"Yahoo News Network","categoryData":[{"term":"YCT:001000780","score":"0.907253","label":"Society"},{"term":"YCT:001000667","score":"0.7751","label":"Crime & Justice"}],"leadItem":false,"body":{"incomplete_body":["<span class=\"referralLink\">This article, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/spring-break-police-lack-control-over-rowdy-college-students/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Police struggle to keep lid on rowdy spring breakers</a>, originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">CBSNews.com</a></span>","","<p>It is peak week for spring break in many of America's sun spots, including Miami.

Rick has evolved into ruthless, kill-to-survive leader, while Morgan has honed his fighting abilities and believes in sparing his enemies in hopes of their own redemption.</p>","<p>Over the weekend, ComicBook.com had the chance to pick the brain of Morgan actor, Lennie James. The British actor was as enthusiastic about the show as ever and spilled some insight into why Morgan thinks Alexandria needs a jail, some excitement over Negan's arrival in the season finale, and much more. Check it out below.</p>","<p><strong>----</strong><strong>-</strong></p>","<p><strong>CB: At first, I was a little skeptical of the whole no killing thing, but now, seeing Rick and the group be so ruthless, I might be flipping to Team Morgan. What kind of response have you seen from fans? Do people agree with you or do people say you need to get out there and kill?</strong></p>","<p>LJ: I think a lot of people have reacted in the way that you did really. I think that your reaction's been pretty universal. I think there was such an expectation on Morgan's return and everybody had their version of what was gonna happen when he got back and I think it's very clever and very brave of Scott [Gimple] and the other writers on the show to walk him down this particular road and walk him down it very carefully and precisely, which is his salvation, the thing that saved him, was Eastman and not killing and opening up the question (which has been there for a while) which is just not about surviving in this post-apocalyptic world but we've gotten to a stage now where we can investigate who we are and how we survive and who we are while we're doing it. So, I think most of the reaction that people have had has been, \"I take your point, I love your character, you need to killÂ some people!\" I think it's partly because of the affection people have for Morgan's friendship with Rick. \"You need to get on Rick's side. You need to be killing everybody!\"</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>So, as the story has gone alone, as the episodes have come in, people have started to go, \"I understand. I understand where he is.\" And some people will go, \"I understand and I'm kind of moving towards Morgan,\" but some people say, \"I really do understand the dilemma but you're still gonnaÂ have to start killing people.\" It's been a variation of those that's been the reaction I've got.</p>","<p><strong>Last week, we saw Father Gabriel become a killer despite having some strong beliefs. Morgan has strong beliefs, too, but does that mean he'll never kill or do you think it's a rule he would bend if necessary?</strong></p>","<p>Well, you have to understand the history of Morgan and where this is coming from. Morgan, on one level, is very different to Father Gabriel. Father Gabriel, however it transpired, didn't kill because of fear in himself. Some people say it was cowardice, some people say it was self-preservation. It was, he was frightened, unable, or unwilling in some way to engage in that side of surviving. Morgan is not killing because he's good at it. He got really good at it. It was all consuming and it's almost like he's an addict to a certain extent and he knows that if he has just one drink, it may well lead him all the way down the road into a binge, which we saw in episode four what he was capable of.</p>","<p>So, Morgan's fear is a fear of himself and knowing what he's capable of and knowing what he can do. I think that that is, as much as it is an external argument that he's having with Rick and Carol and as he stood up the other day and had it with the group, he's also having an internal struggle. He knows what happens on the other side. About two or three times in the season he has intimated or directly asked Rick, \"I shouldn't be here.\" It's a question he has within himself because with other people comes responsibility for other people and with responsibility for other people comes the possibility of having to defend them and with the possibility of having to defend them you may well have to kill for them and Morgan just doesn't want to go back down that road because he knows what it entails.Â </p>","<p><strong>It seems like there's definitely some unfinished business between Morgan and Carol. Is that something we're going to see explored and where does Morgan stand on that relationship?</strong></p>","<p>I think right now they're both kind of figuring it out. I've said in an interview previously that of all the people within the group that may have come across each other pre-apocalypse, the possibilities because of who they were in their previous lives and the way they defined their previous lives which were very much family oriented and Morgan had defined himself by who's father he was and who's husband he was in much the same way that Carol saw who's mother she was and who's wife she was, there's a possibility that their paths may have crossed. They were regular folk who have gone on this massive transformation.</p>","<p>There is a connection between the two of them and at the moment, I don't know that Morgan knows what that means, it's just that he sees something in Carol and part of what he sees in her is the price. Maybe he sees what other people aren't seeing because he sees it within himself but he sees her for the choices that she's made and the choices that she's making and that both worries him, kind of scares him, and draws him towards her, I think.</p>","<p><strong>Last week, we saw you building the jail in Alexandria as Greg NicoteroÂ revealed it to be. What's the intention behind building the jail?</strong></p>","<p>It's kind of like conscientiousÂ objectives during times of war who say that theyÂ don't want to fight but that doesn't mean they don't want to help the struggle so will become medics or stretcher bearers or whatever. Just because Morgan is saying that he doesn't want to kill people, it doesn't mean that he doesn't want to do something to protect the Alexandrians. He knows just from past experience that this town is going to need a jail and it's going to need to be one that is more secure than the one he was in and particularly the one that the Wolf was in. Having seen how easy it was for the W man to get away, Morgan believes the one thing he can contribute to the group and possibly, strangely, maybe save lives, is by building a cell.</p>","<p><strong>Everyone in Alexandria seems to be finding a romantic interest. Is there any romantic plot ahead for Morgan?</strong></p>","<p>All honesty, I don't know. There has been a feeling that everybody's got the love bug in Alexandria and everybody seems to be pairing up. I think it would be an interesting thing to explore for Morgan: whether or not that part of him stillÂ existÂ and whether or not that part of him has any role to play in the journey that he's going on. But at the moment, in absolutely all honesty, I have absolutely no idea if that's even a possibility at this particular moment in time.</p>","<p><strong>Andrew Lincoln, Ross Marquand, and Lauren Cohan have all commented on how brutal the finale of season six is. What are your thoughts on the big episode?</strong></p>","<p>I can only repeat what those guys have said really. I know that Ross has talkedÂ about first reading the script and one of the things that's kind of exciting about this production, this gig doing The Walking Dead, is how many people involved with it both behind the camera and in front of the camera are genuine fans of the show. I know people have said it over and over again but it bears repeating, there's an incredible enthusiasm for this show amongst the people who are making it, let alone the the people who are watching it. So, when that final episode script came out, and there's a lot where you read the script and you arrive on set and say something to other actors and cast or crew and, \"Have you read 13? Have you read 14? Have you seen what happened? Wow! That's gonnaÂ be amazing!\" There's always those conversations but all of that was topped in a massive way when the finale episode of the season came out.</p>","<p>Firstly, it is a phenomenal piece of writing. Secondly, it is one of the greatest introductions of a character that I can remember in any television series, let alone in our television series. It's a phenomenal entrance. I don't want to build it up too much but it's probably to late now. It's amazing. For me, it was two things really. One was it was a sense of, \"Oh, my god. That's gonnaÂ be amazing.\" Two was a desire to see it come to fruition and, from all intensive purposes and everything I know, it's fantastic. Jaws are gonnaÂ drop and people are gonnaÂ lose their shit. It's gonnaÂ blow some people's minds and break some people's hearts.Â </p>"]},"property":"movies","images":[{"caption":"One character who was entirely absent from Sunday&#39;s episode of The Walking Dead was Morgan Jones.

Before Maggie could finish off the guy, whose name we later learned was Donny, a female Savior, Paula (Alicia Witt, killing it), pointed a gun at Carolâs head. And she had two more Saviors with her: an older woman named Molly â Molls, to Paula (and us) â and a brunette about Maggieâs age. So, yeah, check <em>and</em> mate.</p>","<p>Observing through binoculars as, back at Neganâs HQ, fellow Savior Primo was shot off âhisâ bike and apprehended by Rick & Co., Paula intervened (as we knew from last week) via walkie-talkie. Though Donny was eager to get Primo back, as he apparently had the skills needed to treat a gunshot wound, Paula wasnât sold on the deal that Rick offered up. âTwo [hostages] for one?â she scoffed. âThatâs not much of a trade.â</p>","<p><strong>âYOU NEED TO TAKE SOME YOGA BREATHS AND CALM YOUR ASS DOWNâ</strong> <span style=\"color:#999999;\">|</span> After Carol and Maggie were moved to and tied up at the Saviorsâ safe house (which seemed to take its decorating inspiration from the first <em>Saw</em> movie), Carol snagged a rosary from a felled walker being dragged out of the room and pretended to hyperventilate until Molls removed her gag, âfoundâ the rosary in her pocket and gave it to the ânervous little bird.â</p>"],"remaining_body":["<p>âAre you actually afraid to die?â asked Paula, clearly past the point of being scared of anything. Carol replied that what happened to her didnât matter so long as Maggie and her baby were OK. (Which seemed like a bad move, didnât it? Painted a target right across Maggieâs tummy!)</p>","<p>The brunette Savior seemed affected by Maggieâs pregnancy, but neither glacier-cold Paula nor Molls were. Paula laughed that it was âcute,â the idea of making âbite-size snacks for the dead,â and Molls puffed on a cigarette till Carol, backed up by the brunette Savior, had her put it out to spare the kid from secondhand smoke before it was even born. âYâall are worse than a buncha Evangelical second-graders,â Molls huffed. (I know she was evil and all, but câmon, Molls was a hoot and a half, right?)</p>","<p><strong><span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed alignright size-medium wp-image-692790\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oCBaWJvwXvgFNGgNJ1_H9g--/aD00MjA7dz02MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/homerun/tvline.com/2f83d5c34d21d5b6d2857048272e21db\" alt=\"The Walking Dead Recap\" width=\"620\" height=\"420\" /></span>âYOUâRE NOT THE GOOD GUYSâ</strong> <span style=\"color:#999999;\">|</span> Later, as Donnyâs pain intensified, so did his rage. Why should he be messed up when there was Carol, sitting pretty, totally unharmed? âShoot her in the arm, too,â he suggested to Paula. When his significant other refused, he smacked her, prompting Maggie and then Carol to intervene (which, as you can imagine, was hard to do with their hands and feet bound). After interrupting Donnyâs attack on Carol by coldcocking him, Paula had the brunette Savior take Maggie to another room for questioning. It did <em>not</em> go well. In fact, we found out more about the Savior than the Savior did about Maggieâs camp.</p>","<p>Next door, Paula killed time by engaging Carol in some of the nastiest girl talk in the history of both talking and girls. For instance, when Carol said that her faith had gotten her through the death of her daughter, Paula retorted that the good news of her hostageâs predicament was that âmaybe youâll get to see her again soon.â (And you could just <em>tell</em> that Witt was savoring every minute in PaulaâsÂ thick skin.)</p>","<p><strong>âYOU WILL DIEâ</strong> <span style=\"color:#999999;\">|</span> After Paula turned down Rickâs deal, Carol â whose aptitude for acting has come in increasingly handy â lied to her that theyâd killed all the Saviors for fear of retaliation for Daryl taking out the guys whoâd tried to rob him, Sasha and Abraham on the road. Those ill-fated Saviors mentioned Negan, Carol added. Whoâs Negan? âSweetie, sweetie,â answered Molls, âweâre all Negan!â (Cult-y much?)</p>","<p>Next, Paula treated Carol to the story of her life as a wife, mom and secretary who, upon the end of the world, had gradually become a remorseless killer. Deducing that Paula was actually âthe one whoâs afraid to die,â Carol coolly informed her that today would be her last if she didnât accept Rickâs offer. Was Carol going to kill Paula? the Savior asked. âI hope not,â Carol replied. And man, did she ever mean it.</p>","<p>Unfortunately, no sooner had Paula agreed to trade hostages with Rick than sheâd figured out from the lack of static on the radio that his crew was close and probably planning to attack as soon as she and her gang walked out the front door. Since reinforcements were still a ways away, she, Molls and the brunette Savior hastily prepared for an ambush, leaving Carol alone to free herself with the crucifix, then free Maggie as well. Growing ever more reluctant to kill, Carol wanted to leave. Maggie, on the other hand, insisted that they had to finish off the Saviors.</p>","<p class=\"pmc-related-link related\"> <strong class=\"pmc-related-type\">RELATED</strong><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://tvline.com/2016/03/08/into-the-badlands-renewed-season-2-amc/\" title=\"<i data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;;\">Into the Badlands</i> Snags Season 2 Renewal at AMC\"><i>Into the Badlands</i> Snags Season 2 Renewal at AMC</a> </p>","<p><strong>âJUST RUNâ</strong> <span style=\"color:#999999;\">|</span> Discovering Donny already dead and turning, Maggie used him as a weapon with which she could kill Molls. Paula, upon finding the older womanâs body, realized at last how badly sheâd underestimated her hostages and, teary-eyed â hey, she could feel after all! â went after them, guns blazing. Carol tried to let her go, but when a nearby walker that the Saviors were using as a kinda booby trap got free and lunged at Carol, she shot her former captor. Next, the brunette Savior came in and got into it with Maggie, even slashing the mom-to-beâs belly before being shot by Carol. Next â yes, <em>another</em>Â ânextâ; Maggie and Carol really got put through it this week! â Paula stood up, injured but alive, and asked what it was that Carol had been so afraid of. Aiming her gun at Paula, Carol answered, âI was afraid of this.â Before she could pull the trigger, though, Paula made her move. Not that it saved her for long. In the ensuing fight, she was impaled on a plank of wood and turned into Walker Chow.</p>","<p>When Paula reinforcements radioed in, Carol â using her best Paula voice â instructed them to head for âthe kill floor,â where she and Maggie burned them alive. Finally, Rick & Co. arrived. Upon hearing from Carol that no, she wasnât all right, Daryl gave her a big hug. (<em>Aww</em>.) âAre you OK?â Glenn asked Maggie. âI canât anymore,â she replied, dropping the tough-as-nails faÃ§ade sheâd worn the whole dreadful day. Once more, Rick attempted to get intel out of Primo. Whereâd he get the bike? Was Negan at the safe house or at HQ during the assault? âBoth,â Primo said at last. âIâm Negan, sâhead!â In response, Rick immediately shot him in the head as Carol clutched the rosary so tightly that her hand bled.</p>","<p><span style=\"color:#333399;\"><strong>So, do you think Maggie lost/will lose the baby as a result of her injury?
