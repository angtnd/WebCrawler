Professor Marc Edwards leads the Virginia Tech team. He's become a staple in Flint since last summer. Back in August, they tested about 270 homes - that's when they found the unsafe lead levels. Now, they're trying to go back to as many of those homes as they can to compare results. Edwards is hoping to see two to four times less lead in the latest samples. While that's just a guess until the scientific results are in, Edwards says the corrosion control to treat the water is working. Not only that - the city is now using a different water source.

It charged banks more to keep their money with the ECB. It was in line with the Marketâs expectations. However, it surprised the Market by cutting its other two interest rates. The refinancing rate was cut down by five basis points to 0%. The marginal lending rate was cut down to 0.25% from 0.3%. The marginal rate is the rate used by the banks to borrow from the ECB overnight. The ECB increased the monthly asset buying program to 80 billion euros from 60 billion euros. This was more that what the Market expected. It expected about 70 billion euros.</p> <strong>Higher than the Marketâs expectation</strong> <p>The Market was expecting the stimulus from the ECB to turn it into growth. The higher level provided by Mario Draghi, the ECBâs president, indicated that the economy might be slowing at a faster pace than the expected level. There might be more downside risk for the economy. Draghi is doing more on the QE side because QE wasnât very effective in the past.
