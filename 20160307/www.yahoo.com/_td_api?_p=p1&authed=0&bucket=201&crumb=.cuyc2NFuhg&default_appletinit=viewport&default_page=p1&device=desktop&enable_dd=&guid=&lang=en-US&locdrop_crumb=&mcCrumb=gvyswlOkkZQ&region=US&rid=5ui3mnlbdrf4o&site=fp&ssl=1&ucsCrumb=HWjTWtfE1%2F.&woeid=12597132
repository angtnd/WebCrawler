of his casinos, flying on his helicopter and partying aboard his private yacht.<br /></p>","<p> In 1991, Trump first faced questions about his dealings with Robert LiButti, a plump, balding and nationally famous horse breeder with an explosive temper who would later be banned from New Jersey casinos for his ties to Mafia boss John Gotti. At the time, New Jersey state regulators had launched an investigation into allegations by nine employees of one of Trumpâs Atlantic City casinos, the Trump Plaza, that the hotel had repeatedly removed African-Americans and women from craps tables after LiButti, one of the highest-rolling gamblers in the cityâs history, loudly complained about their presence when he was playing. </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/81P_crHV1SRVc7oNbdBxSA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://41.media.tumblr.com/a0974d607c6c125b21007bb7366e1f98/tumblr_inline_o3n3g2cYqe1tdgnv1_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"411.8558077436582\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Robert LiButti, top left, and Donald Trump. (Illustration: Yahoo News; sources: state of New Jersey, William Thomas Cain/Getty Images, Ron Galella/Getty Images)</i></p>"],"remaining_body":["<p> The probe resulted in a $200,000 fine against the Trump Plaza by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission for violating state anti-discrimination laws. Investigators found that LiButti had, on multiple occasions, berated blacks and women using what one state official described as the âvilestâ language â including racist slurs and references to women in obscene terms â and that the Trump Plaza, in order not to lose his substantial business, sought to accommodate him by keeping the employees away from his betting tables, according to commission documents recently obtained by Yahoo News under the New Jersey Open Public Records Act. </p>","<p> âIt was a substantial fine at the time,â said Mitchell A. Schwefel, then a New Jersey assistant attorney general who brought the stateâs case against the Trump Plaza on behalf of the state Division of Gaming Enforcement. âThat was a red-flag issue for us because that was conduct [by the hotel] that was not going to be tolerated.â </p>","<p> Trump was not held personally liable for the violations of his hotel, and there is no indication that he was ever questioned by state officials as part of their investigation. When asked about LiButti by a reporter, the casino mogul suggested he barely knew the foul-mouthed gambler. âI have heard he is a high roller, but if he was standing here in front of me, I wouldnât know what he looked like,â Trump told the Philadelphia Inquirer in February 1991. </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/tBKXAwOQ.Y2SC6nK5mnbVQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://38.media.tumblr.com/0493c42a01e005f70f955edb6aefd105/tumblr_inline_o3n89uCp8y1tdgnv1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"206.9757174392936\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p> But Edith Creamer, LiButtiâs daughter, told Yahoo News in two recent telephone interviews that Trumpâs account was false and that Trump and her father knew each other quite well. âHeâs a liar,â said Creamer. âOf course he knew him. I flew in the [Trump] helicopter with [Trumpâs then wife] Ivana and the kids. My dad flew it up and down [to Atlantic City]. My 35th birthday party was at the Plaza and Donald was there. After the party, we went on his boat, his big yacht. I like Trump, but it pisses me off that he denies knowing my father. That hurts me.â </p>","<p> Asked for comment for this story, Trump, through his spokeswoman, sent this email to Yahoo News: âDuring the years I very successfully ran the casino business, I knew many high rollers. I assume Mr. LiButti was one of them, but I donât recognize the name.â </p>","<p> Trumpâs response to questions about LiButti underscores what critics say is a recurring theme in his career â a tendency to minimize or deny associations with unsavory characters with whom he has done business. Indeed, throughout his career as a real estate mogul there have been frequent allegations of interactions with reputed mob figures â something that may have been inevitable given the mobâs influence in the New York construction industry during that era. (Trump has consistently denied ever knowingly doing business with organized crime.)<b></b> </p>","<p> However, in the case of LiButti, Creamerâs account of direct dealings between her father and Trump would appear to be corroborated by a 1991 book written by John R. OâDonnell, the former president of the Trump Plaza casino. In the book, âTrumped!: The Inside Story of the Real Donald Trump â His Cunning Rise and Spectacular Fall,â OâDonnell recounts a meeting between Trump and LiButti aboard Trumpâs private helicopter, a Super Puma, in the spring of 1988. Trump, according to OâDonnell, agreed to pay $500,000 for a racehorse named Alibi after LiButti showed him color photos of the âluxurious brown coltâ and assured him he was going to be âanother Secretariat.â </p>","<p> OâDonnell doesnât use LiButtiâs name in his book but describes him in unmistakable terms, calling the seller of Alibi a world-famous âhorse brokerâ who was âour most lucrative playerâ at Trump casinos. OâDonnell, in a phone interview, confirmed to Yahoo News for the first time that the broker in question was LiButti. âBob [LiButti] was selling him the horse, for sure,â OâDonnell said. âEverything in the book is true.â </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/3vlalArDckka_.9SpN_FNg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/ccac4083f3c528e0649b0d8c6e446152/tumblr_inline_o3n3m4jvs11tdgnv1_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"238.9873417721519\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>John Gotti on trial and documents pertaining to Robert LiButti from the attorney general in New Jersey. (Photo:Â Daniel Sheehan/AP)</i></p>","<p> Trump, according to OâDonnellâs account, then âinsistedâ that the horse be renamed D.J. Trump. But the deal blew up after the stallion grew lame from illness and Trump sought to renegotiate the purchase price, enraging LiButti and causing him to temporarily boycott Trumpâs casinos, according to OâDonnell. Trump âreneged on the deal when the horse came up lame,â said OâDonnell in the phone interview. (âMr. Trump never owned a racehorse,â said Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks in an email. âHe vaguely remembers someone naming a racehorse after him.â) </p>","<p> <b> </b> </p>","<p> Yahoo News has also obtained the full transcript of a Sept. 4, 1990, undercover New Jersey State Police tape of a conversation between LiButti and Trumpâs top Atlantic City executive, Edward M. Tracy, that appears to lend further credence to Creamerâs account. </p>","<p> The New Jersey police had secretly wired Tracy after two reputed bookmakers for the Gambino crime family told an undercover officer that LiButti was âin Trumpâs pockets.â That, police investigators concluded, was a reference to a highly lucrative contract at the Trump Plaza that LiButti had secured for his brother-in-law, Jimmy Roselli, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/contrary-crooner-jimmy-roselli-overcame-the-wiseguys-8212-and-himself-8212/1179189\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\"> a popular crooner once considered a rival to his childhood Hoboken neighbor, Frank Sinatra </a> . </p>","<p> According to the transcript of the September 1990 meeting, LiButti makes multiple references to conversations he claimed to have had with Trump, telling Tracy, âIâm very close with himâ and recounting how he had been advising Trump to unload one of his Atlantic City casinos to resolve his then highly public business problems. âI told him this right in the helicopter with, ah, Ivana and my daughter one night,â LiButti said to Tracy, according to the transcript. (Although portions of this conversation were reported on at the time, the full transcript â which was recently provided to Yahoo News by a confidential source â includes these and other references to Trump that have not been previously reported.) </p>","<p> <b> </b> </p>","<p> In the conversation, LiButti also offered personal advice, telling Tracy that Trump needed to âget rid of the broadâ â a reference to his then publicized affair with Marla Maples. And he lamented the toll that both the business and personal issues were taking on Trump at the time. </p>","<p> âHeâs lost that aggressiveness. â¦ Walks around like a f***ing banana. I canât believe itâs Donald Trump. I donât understand it,â LiButti says. </p>","<p> âYeah, I know you were shocked when you saw him,â Tracy replies. </p>","<p> âYeah,â says LiButti. âI canât believe it. My hero. Broke my f***ing heart. My f***ing idol. I wanted to grow up like him.â </p>","<p> LiButti recounts how on one occasion, when he had blown $350,000 at the Plaza craps tables, Trump personally handed him a check â apparently as a so-called comp to keep him coming back. âAs Iâm checking out â¦ they call Donald. He goes in his pocket and takes out the f***ing check and goes, âI want to present this to you myself.ââ (When questioned about that claim at the time by reporter David Cay Johnston, then with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Trump denied it, saying, âI never gave him a check at all.â) </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/Ff0IGjAENGboxh2Ir7gzjg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://33.media.tumblr.com/213f941d1bf3ba3fa294536ec324c8a3/tumblr_inline_o3n3hxeXUo1tdgnv1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"197.08609271523179\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p> The secret tape recording proved to be LiButtiâs undoing â but because of other comments he made that day. The gambler was then trying to pressure Tracy to pay an additional $250,000 for Roselliâs services by repeatedly invoking the name of Gotti, the head of the Gambino crime family. LiButti referred to Gotti as âmy boss.â He talked about meetings he had had with Gotti and suggested that he bring him down to Trumpâs Atlantic City casinos. Calling LiButtiâs statements âsinister and chilling,â Assistant Attorney General Schwefel filed a motion before the Casino Control Commission to bar LiButti from all New Jersey casinos on the grounds that he was a Gotti âassociateâ â a request that was approved by the commission on Aug. 21, 1991. </p>","<p> At the time, the Casino Control Commission was also moving to fine Trump Plaza for its past efforts to placate LiButti by keeping blacks and women away from his craps tables. According to the commissionâs documents on the case, LiButti flew into fits of rage whenever he lost money at the craps tables, flinging dice and gaming chips around the casino and grabbing the stick from a stickpersonâs hand and breaking it in half. </p>","<p> He also made it clear that âhe did not want women, blacks or other minorities dealing or supervising his games,â according to one filing by the state Division of Gaming Enforcement. He referred to one Trump Plaza floor person as a âdumb c***â and âdumb bitch,â another as a âJew broadâ and an African-American dealer as a âblack bastard.â Finding himself playing with an African-American at his craps table, LiButti shouted, âShoot the f***ing dice. Shoot the f***ing dice like youâre f***ing some n*****,â according to testimony in the case. </p>","<p> State officials argued that, rather than removing some of its employees from LiButtiâs craps tables, the hotel should have removed LiButti from the casino. But it didnât, the officials contended, because Trumpâs casino had put profits above following the stateâs laws against racial discrimination. </p>","<p> âCertainly, it would have been so much better if the casino itself had thrown LiButti out at the time that he committed these acts, but they didnât because he was a very high roller, obviously,â Schwefel argued at a March 13, 1991, hearing on the case. âIf LiButti had been a five- or 10-dollar customer, they would have thrown him right out, literally without asking any questions. The problem again is that the casino did not want to get rid of a high roller of his dimension.â</p>","<p> Trumpâs lawyers aggressively challenged the charges of discrimination, seeking to discredit the testimony of its employees who filed complaints and arguing it had had âno formal policyâ of removing African-Americans and women from LiButtiâs craps tables. </p>","<p> âTrump Plaza is being found in violation based only on an aura of discrimination,â said Brian Spector, the lawyer for the Trump hotel. âSomething may look like discrimination, feel like discrimination and even smell like discrimination, but you need discriminatory intent. It simply hasnât been proven.â </p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/B0Osrn0.kCgENIkQWPrUcQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MQ--/http://33.media.tumblr.com/b7289e979c0eaf08e8f39fe73ee64d0b/tumblr_inline_o3oew87L0g1tdgnv1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"229.58057395143487\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p> But Casino Control Commission officials didnât buy it, and on June 5, 1991, they doubled the gaming divisionâs recommended $100,000 fine to $200,000 to reflect what one commissioner contended was the âgravely seriousâ nature of the offense. Three months later, the commission leveled another $450,000 fine against the Trump Plaza â this time for buying LiButti nine luxury autos, including Ferraris, Bentleys and Rolls-Royces worth 1.6 million, that he then exchanged for cash, a violation of state laws at the time that barred cash comps for high rollers. Documents from the case show that the Trump Plaza also provided LiButti with other âcompsâ that included paying $104,338 for five European vacations and one to California; $279,978 for tickets to the Super Bowl, boxing matches and other sporting and theater events; $121,712 for jewelry; and $40,020 for Champagne that included 178 bottles of Cristal RosÃ©, valued at $225 a bottle. </p>","<p> It was only the start of LiButtiâs legal problems. He was tried and convicted in 1994 for tax fraud in what federal prosecutors described as the largest case of federal income tax evasion in New Jersey history. A federal judge sentenced him to five years in prison. He died in 2014. </p>","<p> Creamer, LiButtiâs daughter, said her father blamed Trump in part for some of his problems, apparently because Tracy agreed to be wired for the conversation in which he had invoked Gottiâs name. She declined to talk about her fatherâs alleged Mafia associations. âThat is something I donât want to talk about,â she said. But she strongly insisted that her father was not a racist. âHe was a character,â she said. âHe had a heart of gold.â While acknowledging that her father âdid have a foul mouth,â she added that derogatory comments were made to everybody. âHe loved black people,â she said. âHe used to throw them money all the timeâ when he won at the craps table. </p>","<p> And while keenly

And Nancy Reagan certainly did act the part of a woman who stood by her man. But cultural change can also be much more complicated than it at first appears, and in the end, the most traditional of the post-Second Wave feminism first ladies would turn their devotion into a unique kind of power. </p>","<p> From where she stood, Nancy was only and always protecting her husband.

It was, she told Fresh Air host Terry Gross years later, why she turned to astrology to determine the presidential calendar after a 1981 attempt on his life. âWhen a friend called me and said I know this lady who said that if she only could have gotten to you, she could have told you that he shouldnât have done anything that day,â Nancy said, âand I thought, âOh my Lord, I could have saved him maybe.ââ</p>","<figure>\n <span class=\"Embed-Img D-b Ta-c\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-imageloader-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/C4JNnxFE4wTvk4f7E2LwDw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NjQwO3E9NzU7c209MTtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://36.media.tumblr.com/71ed871705dea155798765209dc6e986/tumblr_inline_o3n6174DfE1smb3m3_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"506.7873303167421\"  class=\"Maw-100 ImageLoader-Delayed \"/></span>\n</figure>","<p><i>Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, have their honeymoon dinner at the Stork Club, New York City, 1952.

Nancyâs time in the White House also hardened public suspicion of spouses who dare to use that clout, a pushback felt particularly keenly by Hillary Clinton, when she was put in charge of health care reform during her husbandâs presidency, and by Michelle Obama, whose critics accuse her of wanting to control what Americans eat. </p>","<p> âHer influence was stealth,â Durkin says of Reagan. âShe gazed adoringly, and in doing so, she changed the role well beyond her own time.â</p>","<figure>\n <div class=\"Ratio-16-9 My-18 Cl-b\"><iframe src=\"about:blank\" data-lazyload-src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/yahoo-politics/remembering-nancy-reagan-152609458.html?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"RatioBox Bd-0 \"></iframe></div>\n</figure>"]},"property":"politics","author":"Lisa Belkin","images":[{"caption":"Nancy Reagan owned her role as the woman behind the man","id":"9f47937d-69c2-323e-b9b4-d7fb13689982","title":"Nancy Reagan owned her role as the woman behind the man","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Nancy Reagan owned her role as the woman behind the man","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/5TNJc0f9csVtPgRIpoWh5w--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/53184653bd6c132d83976af1f800645d","alt":null},"index":1},{"caption":"Nancy Reagan owned her role as the woman behind the man","id":"1e7ff03a-dd18-384d-a2ca-e9988fd6a59e","title":"Nancy Reagan owned her role as the woman behind the man","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Nancy Reagan owned her role as the woman behind the man","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/YvHf8pfEBjgC6B9fO98DPw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ffe16882c5fd2d09623bda684c9a939d","alt":null},"index":2},{"caption":"Nancy Reagan owned her role as the woman behind the man","id":"88edef24-0f33-3aca-aeb5-3f70c433dfcd","title":"Nancy Reagan owned her role as the woman behind the man","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Nancy Reagan owned her role as the woman behind the man","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/jT.KjS22c.s38z4CXul6gw--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/3035d3f16e1c0bb17d56668ef8711409","alt":null},"index":3},{"caption":"Former President Ronald Reagan and first ladyÂ Nancy Reagan share a moment as he turns 93.Â (Photo: Getty Images)","id":"35a15a03-a996-3d8e-908a-62b2a23987d7","title":"Nancy and Ronald Reagan at the White House","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Former President Ronald Reagan and first ladyÂ Nancy Reagan share a moment as he turns 93.Â (Photo: Getty Images)","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/cAt0mvNxJbHZpBL0K0Sm1A--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/53a0357e0aa521dfbd8290cd675d7cbb","alt":"Nancy and Ronald Reagan at the White House"},"index":4},{"caption":"Ronald ReaganÂ smiles with his wife,Â Nancy Reagan, circa 1955.Â (Photo: Getty Images)","id":"63d4b459-c6eb-3501-b25a-f52a34e0e29b","title":"Ronald and Nancy Reagan, 1955","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Ronald ReaganÂ smiles with his wife,Â Nancy Reagan, circa 1955.Â (Photo: Getty Images)","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/14nyCrNUEB.p64lZlkS1gg--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/05fdf5594e41f3116d558a8cdc984aee","alt":"Ronald and Nancy Reagan, 1955"},"index":5},{"caption":"Former first ladyÂ Nancy ReaganÂ poses for a portrait at the White House in Washington, D.C.Â (Photo: Getty Images)","id":"24541d3d-0367-308b-98b5-5fd8b8303455","title":"Nancy Reagan at the White House","type":"photo","shortCaption":"Former first ladyÂ Nancy ReaganÂ poses for a portrait at the White House in Washington, D.C.Â (Photo: Getty Images)","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/pFHb3Gd8bgJOwDbxbGS4Ng--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/2efac3dab64bd22384052f16601bf2f1","alt":"Nancy Reagan at the White House"},"index":6},{"caption":"The Reagans shared a laugh with singer Ray Charles. \n (Photo: Getty Images)","id":"de8a5815-f9fc-3cd6-9cd6-c7c9c5f27e4a","title":"Nancy Reagan, Ray Charles, and Ronald Reagan","type":"photo","shortCaption":"The Reagans shared a laugh with singer Ray Charles. \n (Photo: Getty Images)","image":{"src":"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/pKw_YKFIL9x4FHEqpP0PFA--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9NTgwO2g9MzgwO2ZpPWZpdDtzbT0x/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/abdd11a6b5f19c9da45cd4e88387db11","alt":"Nancy Reagan, Ray Charles, and Ronald Reagan"},"index":7},{"caption":"Former first lady Nancy Reagan gestures during a photo opportunity at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California in this March 17, 2010 file photo.

The cave is located about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the renowned Cave of Swimmers (officially known as Wadi Su?ra I), a site discovered in 1933 and made famous by the popular 1992 novel \"The English Patient.\"</p>","<p> The Wadi Su?ra II cave, which can also be described as a shelter because it's more of a rocky overhang, is about 66 feet (20 meters) long and 26 feet (8 m) deep. Roughly 900 stencil paintings of arms, feet, discs, sticks and tiny and large hands cover <a href=\"http://m.livescience.com/49645-rock-art-ancient-earth-lakes.html?fb_comment_id=963948137000147_965275223534105\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">the rock walls</a> inside the cave.</p>","<p> HonorÃ© was stunned the first time she walked into Wadi Su?ra II in 2006. \"I immediately saw those tiny hands among [nearly] thousands of paintings,\" she said.</p>","<p> In earlier studies, researchers hypothesized that the large and small hand paintings were stenciled around adult and baby hands. Yet, shortly after looking at the 13 \"baby\" hand drawings, HonorÃ© concluded that they weren't human.</p>","<p> For one thing, they were too small to belong to a human infant, she said. Moreover, the digits were pointy and \"<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/6807-tiny-footprints-oldest-evidence-reptiles.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">very long and very thin</a>,\" HonorÃ© said. In contrast, human babies have fingers that are roughly the same length as their palms.</p>","<p> \"After a few years, I was obsessed by this idea [that they weren't human],\" HonorÃ© told Live Science. \"It came back to my mind every day, and I decided I had to test it.\"</p>","<p> <strong>Handy experiment</strong></p>","<p> Initially, HonorÃ© compared the hands of her newborn niece and cousins to the rock art. A simple comparison showed that the ancient prints were too small to be human, but she needed a <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/51549-human-hands-are-primitive.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">larger sample of hands</a> to say for sure.

(The other two were incomplete and difficult to measure, she said.) In addition, they measured 30 of the large hands at Wadi Su?ra II and 30 hands from living adults, and found that they matched well, she said.</p>","<p> But several parameters indicated that the tiny hands were not human. Though the stenciled fingers were long, overall the hands were small â just 1.8 inches (4.5 centimeters) from the base of the palm to the end of the middle finger. That's much smaller than a <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/49536-hominin-hands-tool-use.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">human baby hand</a>, which measures an average of 2.4 inches (6.2 cm) long, she said</p>","<p> \"We were completely shocked by our own research because it brought up the question â if it's not babies, what is it?\" HonorÃ© said.</p>","<p> <strong>Hand detective</strong></p>","<p> At first, HonorÃ© thought the tiny hands belonged to a small monkey. But none of the thousands of monkey hand pictures she researched looked like those on the wall at Wadi Su?ra II. Then, when she was doing research at a crocodile farm in Zambia, she realized that the prints belonged to a reptile.</p>","<p> The front feet of the <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/topics/lizards/\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">desert monitor lizard</a> (<em>Varanus</em>) had the closest match to the wall paintings, she found. A <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/7510-baby-crocs-cry-eggs.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">baby crocodile</a> (<em>Crocodylus</em>) was another possibility. However, crocodiles likely didn't live in the desert at that time, so a person would have needed to transport one over from the Nile or another watery region, HonorÃ© said.</p>","<p> Other prehistoric cultures used animals as stencils for their rock art. For example, the Aboriginal people used emu foot stencils in the Carnarvon Gorge and Tent Shelter in Australia, and choike/nandu (birds in the genus <em>Rhea</em>) stencils are in <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/16410-amazing-caves-gallery.html\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">the rock art at La Cueva de las Manos</a> in Argentina, the researchers wrote in the study.</p>","<p> It's unclear why the ancient people at Wadi Su?ra II used reptile hands as stencils, but HonorÃ© said she's working on a new study that analyzes possible reasons.

Not to mention how host Chris Rock will approach the âOscars So Whiteâ controversy, and who he will target during the opening monologue. \n Did Leo finally take home a golden statue? Whose speech was the funniest? Most touching? Controversial? Just how adorable wasÂ nine-year-old Jacob Tremblay? And what moments had everyone talking? \n Related : Who won and who lost at the 2016 Academy Awards \n The buzz began during the red carpet events prior to the official event. Jennifer Jason Leigh, nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for The Hateful Eight , seemed slightly out of it during her interview with Ryan Seacrest on E!âs special. But arguably the biggest surprise was Best Actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio ( The Revenant ) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role nominee Kate Winslet ( Steve Jobs ) playing to their nostalgic fans by walking the red carpet together. Can you believe it&#8217;s been nearly two decades since they starred together in the 1997 blockbuster filmÂ  Titanic Â (which took home Best Picture)? Letâs all let out a collective âAww.â \n Chris Rockâs Opening Monologue \n Right out of the gate, host Chris Rock addressed the elephant in the room: the controversy over the lack of diversity in this yearâs nominations. \n &#8220;Welcome to the Oscars. Or as some people like to call it, the &#8216;white peopleâs choice awards,&#39;&#8221; the comedian joked. &#8220;If hosts were nominated, I wouldnât be here; instead, youâd have Neil Patrick Harris.&#8221; \n Rock, who addressed the issues with ease and expected humor, added that he did seriously consider quitting after so many people spoke out and pressured him to do so. âBut the last thing I need is to lose another job to Kevin Hart,â he said, as the crowd erupted in laughterÂ (including Hart himself, who was in the audience). \n Arguably, the best part of Rockâs monologue was his blatant dig at Jada Pinkett-Smith and her vocal âboycottâ of the Oscars. âIsn&#8217;t she on a TV show? Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihannaâs panties,â he said. âI wasnât invited!â Ouch. \n On a more serious note, Rock suggested that with this being the 88 th annual Academy Awards, the absence of any black nominations has had to have happened already at least 71 other times, including duringÂ the 1950s. âPeople didnât protest back then,â he said, âbecause we had real things to protest at the time.â Double ouch. \n The entire monologue, in fact, was focused on addressing the issue: Rock said this yearâs In Memoriam segment would just cover black people shot by the cops on their way to the movies. He suggested that Hollywood wasn&#8217;t racist in the way we know it, but rather &#8220;sorority racist.&#8221; And, of course, there was his reference to Sylvester Stalloneâs movie Creed as âBlack Rocky,â which takes place in a fictional world where white athletes are as good as black ones. \n While Rock hit it out of park in addressing the #oscarssowhite issues, it would have been nice if he made at least a portion of the monologue about the actual movies. That said, hopefully thereâs more humor to come beyond the topic of race throughout the broadcast. Stay tuned. \n Best Moments \n The spoof video about how itâs tough for black actors to get good roles \n Rock&#8217;s focus on black actors continued. And leave it to the funnyman toÂ inject this focusÂ into Oscar-nominated films in the most hilarious and, in one case, creepiest ways. It started with Whoopi Goldberg mopping the floors in a scene from Joy , where she mocks Jennifer Lawrenceâs character for not being able to speak on camera about her new mop. Of course a white girl gets an entire movie made about her because she invented a mop, she says. A black person would have to invent a cure for cancer! \n We also see Saturday Night Live âs Leslie Jones in place of the bear that attacks Leonarodo DiCaprio in The Revenant , presumably after he failed to call her back after a date. In another clip, Rock himself plays the title role in theÂ  The Martian , while Jeff Daniels and Kristen Wiig contemplate whether to spend the $2,500 âwhite dollarsâ it would require to retrieve the black astronaut from outer space. But the real treat was Tracy Morgan in a dress wearing red lipstick and eating a pastry in his version of The Danish Girl . Welcome back, Tracy! \n Rock calling Sam Smith George Michael \n Blink and you might have missed it, but after Sam Smith performed his Oscar-nominated tuneÂ  Writingâs on the Wall from the latest James Bond movie Spectre , Rock pointed his way and applauded the musician, noting that Father Figure is his favorite song. That tune was, of course, written by another notable openly homosexual Brit, George Michael. Guess Rock figures he&#8217;d even the playing field on the stereotyping front? But Smith got the last laugh; when he later picked up his Oscar for the song, he dedicated it to the LGBT community. \n Tina Fey pretends sheâs drunk \n While presenting the award for Production Design alongside Steve Carell, who appears in Best Picture nominated flick The Big Short , Tina Fey tried to pretend she was inebriated. Production design can take us to unusual places, the pair told us, as Fey offered up the example of âthat place where a bear lives.â She continued to purposely slur her words. Cute. \n Jared Leto collectively gets the world to Google the word âmerkinâ \n While introducing the award for Hairstyling alongside Margot Robbie, Oscar winner Jared Leto undoubtedly caused a collective &#8220;Google&#8221; for the word âmerkinâ as he referenced the, er, unique âhairstyleâ type as being one that was occasionally required during filming. Do you know what a merkin is? If not, get ready for a hearty laugh once you look it up &#8212; #merkin. \n The real Suge Knight \n Rock highlighted several people in attendance on whom roles were based, including the real Michael Rezendes from the movie Spotlight (he was played by Oscar nominee Mark Ruffalo)Â and the real Joy Mangano from Joy ( played in the movie by Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence). Then, he cut to the âreal Suge Knightâ from Straight Outta Compton , showing a bald black man strapped to a gurney in an orange jumpsuit, flanked by two cops. Way to help the cause, Rock! \n âWould like to thankâ ticker \n What a clever way to ensure that award recipients can thank everyone theyâd like to, but also get on and off the stage quickly while avoiding the dreaded hurry-up music. As award recipients walked up on stage, a ticker (presumably when provided) appeared at the bottom of the screen, with a scrolling list of who theyâd like to thank. Okay, so it&#8217;s a bit informal, but at least winners don&#8217;t need to worry about forgetting anyone! \n Black history month honoring Jack Black \n Angela Bassett appeared in a short clip from the Academy to honor Black History Month, highlighting that great âblackâ actor, Jack Black. All right, Academy Awards. We get it. Youâre poking fun at yourself. Clever. \n C3PO and R2-D2 make a quick appearance \n The dynamic Star Wars duo of C-3PO and R2-D2 appear on stage, alongside BB-8, the droid from the new movie, for a quick bit of comic relief. After scolding his pal for forgetting the envelope, C-3PO looks over at a big photo of the golden Oscar statue and remarks that it looks like him (itâs certainly not the other way around). It was nice and all, but can this movie win an award, already? \n Please, buy some Girl ScoutÂ cookies \n Rock urges the audience to buy some Girl ScoutÂ cookies from his daughters, since heâs been away and missed the selling season and the opportunity for them to beat out that friend that always sells the most. Everyone from Kate Winslet to Lou Gossett Jr. was happy to fork over a few bucks for a box of thin mints to help out. After all, these stars are probably starving as they wait for the dinner portion to start! And hey, talk about some fantastic free advertising for the Girl Scouts. By the way, it&#8217;s clear Rock&#8217;s daughters won this year: he revealed later in the broadcast that over $65,000 worth of cookies were sold. \n Kevin Hart gives a heartfelt speech? \n Who would have thought that Kevin Hart of all people would be the one to speak most eloquently about diversity issues. When appearing on stage briefly to introduce The Weeknd, who performed his Oscar-nominated song Earned It from Fifty Shades of Grey , the comedian urged his fellow black actors not to focus on tonight and these awards. Rather, focus on doing what we love, working hard, and doing it well. Couldnât have said it better. \n Interview of passers-by outside a theater in Compton \n Taking a tip from late night TV hosts, Rock showed a segment whereby he interviewed passers-by in front of a movie theater in Compton about the diversity controversy. The best part: one woman who believes heâs making up the names of the actual nominated movies. Rock revisited the diversity issue far too much, and probably did so on purpose. Why quit the job, after all, when you can simply make the entire three-hour broadcast about the diversity issues? \n Twitter games \n Rock attempted to start his own Oscar game by Tweeting in the middle of the broadcast and asking that viewers take a shot every time he makes the audience feel uncomfortable. Awk-ward. \n Chris Rock insults Asians? \n In attempt to spread the lack of diversity &#8220;love,&#8221; Rock brought out three Asian children, presumably representing PricewaterhouseCoopers. If the joke offended you, he says, just Tweet about it on your phones that were made by these three kids as well. Clearly, nothing was off limits. \n Dave Grohl singsÂ the In Memoriam segment \n Foo Fighters frontmanÂ Dave Grohl&#8217;s performance of the Beatles&#8217;Â  Blackbird live on stage to celebrate those we lost this year, was truly beautiful. MentionsÂ included Wes Craven, Robert Loggia, Maureen OâHara, Omar Sharif, Alan Rickman, David Bowie, Leonard Nimoy, and more. \n Joe Biden asks college kids to take a pledge against sexual abuse \n In a passionate speech, Vice President Joe Biden asks everyone to take the pledge that they will intervene if they see someone in a position where they are not giving consent, or may not be able to give consent, to prevent them from becoming a victim of sexual abuse. It was a fitting introduction to Lady Gagaâs powerful and moving performance of âTil It Happens to You from The Hunting Ground. \n Sacha Baron Cohen presents as Ali \n Sacha Baron Cohen presented an award as one of his many hilarious alter egos, Ali G. âI know what you are all thinking,â he says in the characterâs signature street accent. âAnother token black presenter.â Following a few racially-charged jokes, he adds that heâs presenting in honor of all of those who have been overlooked, including black character from Star Wars: Darth Vader. Ah, how we miss Ali G. \n Leonardo DiCaprio gets a standing ovation \n After six nominations and zero wins, itâs no surprise that Leonardo DiCaprio received a standing ovation following his big win for Best Actor for The Revenant . He used the platform to discuss his environmental concerns about climate change and the threats it poses. Good on him for using his win not to promote himself, but an important cause. âLet us not take this planet for granted,â he ended. âI do not take tonightÂ for granted.â \n \n \n Also watch: Sidd Srinivasa on Where Home Robots Will Be in Five Years \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Please enable Javascript to watch this video","id":"29da4cdf-1a09-3ba0-81e7-15a1d229fe94","title":"Here are the most buzzworthy moments from the 2016 Oscars","type":"photo","shortCaption":"The 88th annual Academy Awards are underway, andÂ viewers are anxiously awaiting the ceremony to find out if their favoriteÂ flicks and actors win, which categoriesÂ will seeÂ big âupsets,â and which speeches and performances will stand out.

According to the latest report by the Social Security trustees, the trust funds will be completely depleted in 2034, at which time the only money available to pay out benefits will be the payroll taxes coming in. This is expected to cover about three-fourths of promised benefits, so something clearly needs to be done if we want to fulfill our promises to seniors. When it comes to fixing Social Security, there are two main options -- cut benefits or increase taxes.</p>","<p><strong>Ways to cut benefits<br /> </strong>Across the board benefit cuts are extremely unpopular on both sides of the political spectrum -- after all, both democrats and republicans rely on Social Security for retirement income. However, there are other ways to cut back that could help with the shortfall.</p>","<ul> \n <li><strong>Increasing the minimum retirement age</strong>Â -- For people born after 1960, the full retirement age for Social Security will be 67. Reduced benefits are available as early as age 62 for those who want to retire early. By gradually increasing the retirement age to 68, or even 70, it could help bridge the gap. However, this could be a challenge politically, as a study by the National Academy of Social Insurance and Greenwald & Associates found that 65% of the population opposes increasing the normal retirement age past 67.</li> \n <li><strong>Using more working years to calculate benefits</strong>Â -- Currently, Social Security benefits are determined by an inflation-indexed average of a worker's 35 highest-earning years. By taking more years into account, say 38 or 40, it would add more years to the low end of the calculation and would drag down the wages that benefits are based on.</li> \n <li><strong>Cutting benefits for high-income individuals</strong>Â -- Social Security benefits are already weighted in favor of lower-income workers. By further reducing the amount of Social Security benefits that go to the people who need them the least, it could save some much-needed money.</li> \n <li><strong>Slowing down cost-of-living increases </strong>-- Cost-of-living increases are designed to help retirees keep up with inflation, and are currently based on the consumer price index (CPI). By switching to a slower-growing index like the \"chained\" CPI, it could save considerable money over the long term. This is likely to be an uphill battle, as the NASI survey projects that this would only solve 20% of the shortfall and would be opposed by more than three-fourths of the population.</li> \n</ul>"],"remaining_body":["<p>Most republicans are in favor of some type of benefit cuts, and there are variations of each of the above solutions being discussed by the presidential candidates. Keep in mind that since both sides of the political spectrum rely on Social Security, some of the possible solutions have broad bipartisan support.</p>","<p><strong>Increasing taxes is a popular solution<br /> </strong>If we don't want to change benefits, the other way to eliminate the shortfall is to increase Social Security taxes. As of 2016, 6.2% of the first $118,500 in earned income is paid as Social Security tax by both the employer and the employee -- so 12.4% in total. And, just as with the benefit cuts I discussed earlier, there are several ways this could happen.</p>","<ul> \n <li><strong>Gradually increasing Social Security taxes </strong>-- Immediate payroll tax increases are unpopular, and are unlikely to gain any serious political support, but an increase of either 1% or 2% of income phased in over a decade or more could be a possibility. A relatively painless increase of the payroll tax to 7.2% phased in over 20 years would take care of more than half of the shortfall, and is supported by 83% of survey respondents.</li> \n <li><strong>Raise or remove the wage cap</strong>Â -- Since only the first $118,500 of income is taxed for Social Security, there is a lot of potential revenue to be had by taxing more of high earners' income. Eliminating the wage cap altogether over a 10 year phase-in would knock out 74% of the shortfall and is supported by 80% of the population -- including 76% of those earning more than $100,000.</li> \n</ul>","<p><strong>A third option?<br /> </strong>There could be a third option which hasn't been talked about much -- increase Social Security revenue without raising payroll taxes by simply diverting other money into the program. For example, one candidate has suggested that we should reduce our foreign aid to potentially hostile countries, and instead direct that portion of the budget into Social Security's coffers.</p>","<p>This is indeed an interesting idea, but is unlikely to take care of the shortfall all by itself, so it would need to be used in conjunction with other reforms. Even so, the possibility of maintaining Social Security's solvency without major benefit cuts <em>or</em> tax increases could become quite popular.</p>","<p><strong>What's likely to happen<br /> </strong>History indicates that <em>something</em> will be done to fix the system. And, it's likely to involve a combination of the options discussed here. Certain measures, such as across-the-board cuts, are unlikely to get any serious political momentum, but as we've seen, there are some options that are quite popular.</p>","<p>Whatever happens to Social Security, keep in mind that the presidential candidates' Social Security plans should be taken with a grain of salt. Whatever reforms are ultimately chosen will have to go through Congress, and it's unlikely that our next president will completely get his or her way.</p>","<p><p><strong>The $15,978 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook</strong> <br />If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually. For example: one easy, 17-minute trick could pay you as much as $15,978 more... each year! Once you learn how to take advantage of all these loopholes, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.Â <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/mms/mark/ecap-foolcom-social-security?aid=8727&source=irreditxt0000002&ftm_cam=the-motley-fool&ftm_pit=3186&utm_campaign=article&utm_medium=feed&utm_source=yahoo-2\" data-ylk=\"itc:0;elm:context_link;\">Simply click here to discover how you can take advantage of these strategies.</a></p></p>"]},"property":"finance"},{"type":"story","is_eligible":"false","id":"cdd8afff-f1e9-3592-b6fd-3ac23c77a44b","categoryLabel":"Entertainment","cluster_id":"a1364c99-00d5-3ab7-8a23-025507babd27","licensed":"false","title":"What Chris Rock&#39;s Asian-American jab at Oscars reveals about Hollywood&#39;s diversity problem","link":"http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2016/0305/What-Chris-Rock-s-Asian-American-jab-at-Oscars-reveals-about-Hollywood-s-diversity-problem","summary":"TV&#39;s &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot; creator Nahnatchka Khan was reveling in Oscar host Chris Rock&#39;s deft comedic assault on white-fixated Hollywood. &quot;It&#39;s like going on a road trip with your fun friend, and halfway to Vegas he pulls over and shoots you in the leg,&quot; Khan said, recalling her reaction to last weekend&#39;s ceremony.
